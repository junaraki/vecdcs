While anti-statism is central , anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of human relations , including , but not limited to , the state system .
There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation , such as William Godwin and Wilhelm Weitling , but they did not use the word `` anarchist '' or `` anarchism '' in describing themselves or their beliefs .

As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the French Revolution , William Godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought .
Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy , he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power .
Rather , he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution .
His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce , as a manifestation of the people 's ` mental enslavement ' , the foundations of law , property rights and even the institution of marriage .
His opposition to the state , organised religion , and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists , and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time .
In Spain Ramón de la Sagra established the anarchist journal `` El Porvenir '' in La Coruña in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon ´ s ideas .
In 1864 the International Workingmen 's Association -LRB- sometimes called the `` First International '' -RRB- united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of Proudhon , Blanquists , Philadelphes , English trade unionists , socialists and social democrats .
One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy , while a technical excuse -- that they had split away from the Fédération Romande -- was used to avoid inviting Bakunin 's Swiss supporters .
The Paris Commune was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March -LRB- more formally , from 28 March -RRB- to 28 May 1871 .
In response , unions across the United States prepared a general strike in support of the event .
On 3 May , in Chicago , a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line , and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd .
Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed .
Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer .
In 1890 a second attempt , this time international in scope , to organise for the eight-hour day was made .

In 1907 , the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam gathered delegates from 14 different countries , among which important figures of the anarchist movement , including Errico Malatesta , Pierre Monatte , Luigi Fabbri , Benoît Broutchoux , Emma Goldman , Rudolf Rocker , and Christiaan Cornelissen .
Moreover , they were clearly meant to be `` exemplary '' invitations to revolt . '' .
However , as soon as 1887 , important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts .
The anarcho-syndicalist , Fernand Pelloutier , argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without `` the individual dynamiter . ''
McKinley 's assassin Leon Czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman .
Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after World War I -LRB- 1914 -- 1918 -RRB- and the 1917 October Revolution .
Russian Revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s .

Anarchists participated alongside the Bolsheviks in both February and October revolutions , and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution .
Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned , driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks ;
the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine .
Expelled American anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising , before they left Russia .
The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally .
Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example ;
In France and the United States , for example , members of the major syndicalist movements of the CGT and IWW left the organisations and joined the Communist International .
In the Italian events known as the `` biennio rosso '' the anarcho-syndicalist trade union Unione Sindacale Italiana `` grew to 800,000 members and the influence of the Italian Anarchist Union -LRB- 20,000 members plus `` Umanita Nova '' , its daily paper -RRB- grew accordingly ... Anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces .
The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers ' social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years , primarily Catalonia , Aragon , Andalusia , and parts of the Levante .
Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- , Group of Eight , and the World Economic Forum .
These actions were precipitated by ad hoc , leaderless , anonymous cadres known as `` black blocs '' ;

A significant event of this period was the confrontations at WTO conference in Seattle in 1999 .
it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest ;
International anarchist federations in existence include the International of Anarchist Federations , the International Workers ' Association , and International Libertarian Solidarity .
CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003 .
Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden and the Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation ;
the CNT-AIT in France ;
the Union Sindicale Italiana in Italy ;
in the US Workers Solidarity Alliance and the UK Solidarity Federation and Anarchist Federation .
Anarchist schools of thought .
Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions , individualist anarchism and social anarchism , which have some different origins , values and evolution .
The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty , i.e. opposition to state or social control over the individual , while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one 's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill , `` recognizing equality of entitlement '' .
Godwin advocated individualism , proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good .
Stirner 's `` The Ego and Its Own '' , published in 1844 , is a founding text of the philosophy .
05: own-8 JJ -> NN
To Stirner , rights were `` spooks '' in the mind , and he held that society does not exist but `` the individuals are its reality '' .
It was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and LGBT activist John Henry Mackay .
Henry David Thoreau -LRB- 1817 -- 1862 -RRB- was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe .
Thoreau was an American author , poet , naturalist , tax resister , development critic , surveyor , historian , philosopher , and leading transcendentalist .
He is best known for his books `` Walden '' , a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings , and his essay , `` Civil Disobedience '' , an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state .
This was to be achieved through violent revolution , first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence , or `` propaganda by the deed '' , which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production .
Through the efforts and influence of the Spanish Anarchists during the Spanish Revolution within the Spanish Civil War , starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon , parts of the Levante and Andalusia , as well as in the stronghold of Anarchist Catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the regime that won the war , Hitler , Mussolini , Spanish Communist Party repression -LRB- backed by the USSR -RRB- as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself .
For Godwin education had to have `` A respect for the child 's autonomy which precluded any form of coercion , '' `` A pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child 's own motivation and initiatives , '' and `` A concern about the child 's capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school . ''
Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months , become established by age two or three years , and tend to continue through adulthood , although often in more muted form .
Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to defines a person 's own emotions .
In the second and third years , children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling , consonants , words , and word combinations ;
Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language .
In a pair of studies , high-functioning children with autism aged 8 -- 15 performed equally well as , and adults better than , individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling .
Although some children with autism also have gastrointestinal symptoms , there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that children with autism have more or different gastrointestinal symptoms than usual ;
However , most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified .
Typically , autism can not be traced to a Mendelian -LRB- single-gene -RRB- mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality , and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD .
All known teratogens -LRB- agents that cause birth defects -RRB- related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception , and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later , there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development .
It is thought that activation of a pregnant mother 's immune system such as from environmental toxicants or infection can contribute to causing autism through causing a disruption of brain development .
The mirror neuron system -LRB- MNS -RRB- theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism 's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties .
In people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time , suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks , possibly reflecting a disturbance of self-referential thought .
Evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by a brainwave study that suggested that adults with ASD have local overconnectivity in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex .
These theories are somewhat related to Baron-Cohen 's earlier theory of mind approach , which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others .
Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence , but performance never reaches typical adult levels .
One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people .
A related theory -- enhanced perceptual functioning -- focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals .
A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful .
These deficits are present in early childhood , typically before age three , and lead to clinically significant functional impairment .
ICD-10 uses essentially the same definition .
Several diagnostic instruments are available .
Two are commonly used in autism research : the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised -LRB- ADI-R -RRB- is a semistructured parent interview , and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule -LRB- ADOS -RRB- uses observation and interaction with the child .
years later , adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves , to help their employers make adjustments , or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits .
The terminology of autism can be bewildering , with autism , Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the `` autism spectrum disorders '' -LRB- ASD -RRB- or sometimes the `` autistic disorders '' , whereas autism itself is often called `` autistic disorder '' , `` childhood autism '' , or `` infantile autism '' .
vaccination against rubella can prevent many of those cases .
Management .
The main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress , and to increase quality of life and functional independence .
claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated .
Available approaches include applied behavior analysis -LRB- ABA -RRB- , developmental models , structured teaching , speech and language therapy , social skills therapy , and occupational therapy .
Various DSP programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at-home parent implementation .
Despite the recent development of parent training models , these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies , being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment .
Similarly , teacher-implemented intervention that utilizes an ABA combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be a well-established treatment in improving social-communication skills in young children , although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms .
Treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality-of-life contexts , and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance .
US states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services , shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance .
Society and culture .
The emergence of the autism rights movement has served as an attempt to encourage people to be more tolerant of those with autism .
There have also been many organizations dedicated to increasing the awareness of autism and the effects that autism has on someone 's life .
While many autistics do n't have these special abilities , there are some autistic individuals who have been successful in their fields .
this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not .
reported rates in unselected samples of children with ASD have ranged from 3 % to 25 % .
Few high-quality studies address long-term prognosis .
no study has focused on autism after midlife .
Acquiring language before age six , having an IQ above 50 , and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes ;
In 2012 , the NHS estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the UK was 1.1 % .
a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics .
Several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated , but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed ;
The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers ;
two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm , and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism .
The Wild Boy of Aveyron , a feral child caught in 1798 , showed several signs of autism ;
the medical student Jean Itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation .
He derived it from the Greek word `` autós '' -LRB- αὐτός , meaning `` self '' -RRB- , and used it to mean morbid self-admiration , referring to `` autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies , against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance '' .
It is , however , common to assume a surface reflects in either a totally specular manner or a totally diffuse manner , as this can simplify calculations .
The albedo is an important concept in climatology , astronomy , and calculating reflectivity of surfaces in LEED sustainable-rating systems for buildings .
The term was introduced into optics by Johann Heinrich Lambert in his 1760 work `` Photometria '' .
Terrestrial albedo .
Albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal , one of the darkest substances .
The average albedo of Earth is about 0.3 .
Earth 's surface albedo is regularly estimated via Earth observation satellite sensors such as NASA 's MODIS instruments on board the Terra and Aqua satellites .
Earth 's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about 15 ° C .
In contrast , if the entire Earth is covered by water -- a so-called aquaplanet -- the average temperature on the planet would rise to just under 27 ° C.
For small and far objects that can not be resolved by telescopes , much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos .
Another notable high-albedo body is Eris , with an albedo of 0.96 .
A typical comet nucleus has an albedo of 0.04 .
Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds .
Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the -LRB- V-band -RRB- geometric albedo -LRB- measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer -RRB- and the Bond albedo -LRB- measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected -RRB- .
cold and dry which form over temperate , polar and sub-polar land masses ;
Different temperatures between the air masses result in different air pressures , and the masses develop into pressure systems .
however due to the spinning of Earth , the Coriolis effect further complicates flow and creates several weather/climate bands and the jet streams .
Over Antarctica they average a little more than 0.8 .
If a marginally snow-covered area warms , snow tends to melt , lowering the albedo , and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack -LRB- the ice -- albedo positive feedback -RRB- .
Research showed impacts of over 10 % .
More recently , the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials -LRB- both human-made and natural -RRB- and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies : industrial -LRB- solar farms -RRB- , commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications .

Its name must have corresponded closely to the Hebrew or Arabic aleph .
In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the Greek Dark Ages , dating to the 8th century BC , the letter rests upon its side , but in the Greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter , although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg , or by the angle at which the cross line is set .

They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas .
Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature .
A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination , `` a minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature . ''
This benefited the urban areas that had developed , as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years .
During the 1960s , under Governor George Wallace , Alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation.The civil rights movement had notable events in Alabama , including the Montgomery Bus Boycott -LRB- 1955 -- 56 -RRB- , Freedom Rides in 1961 , and 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches .

The Legislature is responsible for writing , debating , passing , or defeating state legislation .
The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both houses of the Legislature .
The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority -LRB- most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto -RRB- .
This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas .

Roads .
Alabama has five major interstate roads that cross the state : Interstate 65 -LRB- I-65 -RRB- travels north -- south roughly through the middle of the state ;
I-20 / I-59 travel from the central west Mississippi state line to Birmingham , where I-59 continues to the north-east corner of the state and I-20 continues east towards Atlanta ;
A sixth route , I-685 , will be formed when I-85 is rerouted along a new southern bypass of Montgomery .
A proposed northern bypass of Birmingham will be designated as I-422 .
Since a direct connection from I-22 to I-422 will not be possible , I-222 has been proposed , as well .

For this reason , the two gods withdrew their pursuit , and had her wed Peleus .
Thetis , although a daughter of the sea-god Nereus , was also brought up by Hera , further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus .
However , he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him , his heel -LRB- see Achilles heel , Achilles ' tendon -RRB- .
She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage .
However , none of the sources before Statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability .
To the contrary , in the `` Iliad '' Homer mentions Achilles being wounded : in Book 21 the Paeonian hero Asteropaeus , son of Pelagon , challenged Achilles by the river Scamander .
Telephus .
When the Greeks left for the Trojan War , they accidentally stopped in Mysia , ruled by King Telephus .
Guided by the oracle , he arrived at Argos , where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy .
Achilles refused , claiming to have no medical knowledge .
Alternatively , Telephus held Orestes for ransom , the ransom being Achilles ' aid in healing the wound .
In Dares Phrygius ' `` Account of the Destruction of Troy '' , the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe , Troilus was a young Trojan prince , the youngest of King Priam 's -LRB- or sometimes Apollo -RRB- and Hecuba 's five legitimate sons .
As the battle turns against the Greeks , thanks to the influence of Zeus , Nestor declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles , and urges the king to appease the warrior .
Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him , and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do .
The Trojans , led by Hector , subsequently push the Greek army back toward the beaches and assault the Greek ships .
After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from Antilochus , the son of Nestor , Achilles grieves over his beloved companion 's death and holds many funeral games in his honor .
The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by Hera and Hephaestus .
Zeus himself takes note of Achilles ' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction , seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself .
The death of Achilles , as predicted by Hector with his dying breath , was brought about by Paris with an arrow -LRB- to the heel according to Statius -RRB- .
Another version of Achilles ' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses , Polyxena .
Fate of Achilles ' armor .
Achilles ' armor was the object of a feud between Odysseus and Telamonian Ajax -LRB- Ajax the greater -RRB- .
After a while , when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep , Ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide .
However , it was shown in the time of Pausanias in the 2nd century AD .
Numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions .
They were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle .
The Trojans attacked and reached the heroes , who were saved only by an intervention of Athena .
In the `` Iliad '' , it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship .
Despite there being no direct evidence in the text of the Iliad that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers , this theory was expressed by some later authors .
There the Achaeans raised a tumulus for him and celebrated funeral games .
Pausanias has been told that the island is `` covered with forests and full of animals , some wild , some tame .
05: full-14 JJ -> NN
The Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetus of Bithynia , who lived at the time of Domitian , writes that the island was called `` Leuce '' `` because the wild animals which live there are white .
One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin , in which Achilles is praised and celebrated .
There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds , which look after Achilles ' temple .
And after they finish the sprinkling , they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings .
Other people say still more , that some of the men who reach this island , come here intentionally .
As they have no sacrificial animals , but wish to get them from the god of the island himself , they consult Achilles ' oracle .
And then the victim does n't run away any more , but waits willingly to be caught .

The heroic cult of Achilles on Leuce island was widespread in antiquity , not only along the sea lanes of the Pontic Sea but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the Black Sea .
With Lycomedes ' daughter Deidamia , whom in the account of Statius he rapes , Achilles there fathers a son , Neoptolemus -LRB- also called Pyrrhus , after his father 's possible alias -RRB- .
The kings of the Epirus claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son , Neoptolemus .
Alexander the Great , son of the Epirote princess Olympias , could therefore also claim this descent , and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor .
The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War , including his defeat of Hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by Paris and guided by Apollo punctures his heel .
Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles , being the younger and more beautiful of the two , was the beloved , who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him .
This strand continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius and in Benoît de Sainte-Maure 's `` Roman de Troie '' and Guido delle Colonne 's `` Historia destructionis Troiae '' , which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the Matter of Troy until the 17th century .

Aristotle
Aristotle -LRB- ;
, `` Aristotélēs '' ;
384322 BC -RRB- was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the Macedonian city of Stagira , Chalkidice , on the northern periphery of Classical Greece .
Teaching Alexander the Great gave Aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies .
He established a library in the Lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books .
He believed all peoples ' concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception .
Some of Aristotle 's zoological observations , such as on the hectocotyl -LRB- reproductive -RRB- arm of the octopus , were not confirmed or refuted until the 19th century .
All aspects of Aristotle 's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today .
Life .
Aristotle , whose name means `` the best purpose '' , was born in 384 BC in Stagira , Chalcidice , about 55 km -LRB- 34 miles -RRB- east of modern-day Thessaloniki .
He wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived .
they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students .
His most important treatises include `` Physics '' , `` Metaphysics '' , `` Nicomachean Ethics '' , `` Politics '' , `` De Anima '' -LRB- `` On the Soul '' -RRB- and `` Poetics '' .
In general , the details of the life of Aristotle are not well-established .
The biographies of Aristotle written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points .
Thought .
Logic .
With the `` Prior Analytics '' , Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic , and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th century advances in mathematical logic .
Logic seems to have emerged from dialectics ;
the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like `` reductio ad absurdum '' in their discussions , but never truly understood the logical implications .
Consequently , Plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial .
He never succeeded in devising such a method , but his best attempt was published in his book `` Sophist '' , where he introduced his division method .
The order of the books -LRB- or the teachings from which they are composed -RRB- is not certain , but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle 's writings .
Aristotle 's epistemology .
Like his teacher Plato , Aristotle 's philosophy aims at the universal .
Aristotle 's ontology , however , finds the universal in particular things , which he calls the essence of things , while in Plato 's ontology , the universal exists apart from particular things , and is related to them as their prototype or exemplar .
By practical science , he means ethics and politics ;
by poetical science , he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts ;
If logic -LRB- or `` analytics '' -RRB- is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy , the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy would consist of : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Logic ;
He had a conception of speed and temperature , but no quantitative understanding of them , which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices , like clocks and thermometers .
Aristotle also had some scientific blind spots .
He posited a geocentric cosmology that we may discern in selections of the `` Metaphysics '' , which was widely accepted up until the 16th century .
However , Aristotle 's scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields .
Moreover , he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants .
He instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up , and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized .
The changes of the earth , he says , are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives , that they are overlooked ;
He says -LSB- 12th chapter of his `` Meteorics '' -RSB- ` the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time , but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land , and again it becomes land where it was sea , and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain system , and within a certain period . '
06: think-56 VBG -> NN
He dissected animals but not humans ;
his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded .
Empirical research program .
Aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail .
The works that reflect this research , such as `` History of Animals '' , `` Generation of Animals '' , and `` Parts of Animals '' , contain some observations and interpretations , along with sundry myths and mistakes .
In some respects , this incomplete classification is better than that of Linnaeus , who crowded the invertebrata together into two groups , Insecta and Vermes -LRB- worms -RRB- .
Aristotle believed that intellectual purposes , i.e. , final causes , guided all natural processes .
Such a teleological view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design .
Noting that `` no animal has , at the same time , both tusks and horns , '' and `` a single-hooved animal with two horns I have never seen , '' Aristotle suggested that Nature , giving no animal both horns and tusks , was staving off vanity , and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary .
Herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries , noting that the latter pulse while the former do not .
Aristotle 's ideas of natural history and medicine survived , but they were generally taken unquestioningly .
Psychology .
Aristotle 's psychology , given in his treatise On the Soul -LRB- `` peri psyche '' , often known by its Latin title `` De Anima '' -RRB- , posits three kinds of soul -LRB- `` psyches '' -RRB- : the vegetative soul , the sensitive soul , and the rational soul .
Aristotle uses the word `` memory '' for two basic abilities .
First , the actual retaining of the experience in the mnemonic `` imprint '' that can develop from sensation .
Therefore , memory is of the past , prediction is of the future , and sensation is of the present .
However , they can not be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new `` imprints '' .
Young people undergo rapid changes as they develop , while the elderly 's organs are beginning to decay , thus stunting new `` imprints '' .
Because intellectual functions are not involved in memory , memories belong to some animals too , but only those in which have perception of time .
If the chain of `` images '' is not needed , but expected , then it will only stimulate the other memory in most instances .
Animals that have perception of time will be able to retrieve memories of their past observations .
Recollection of an `` imprint '' is when the present experiences a person remembers are similar with elements corresponding in character and arrangement of past sensory experiences .
04: corresponding-19 JJ -> NN
Since a person can not sense during sleep they can also not have a desire , which is the result of a sensation .
In dreams , sensation is still involved , but in an altered manner than when awake .
When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention , it leaves an impression .
For example , a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings .
He claimed that dreams are not foretelling and that they are not sent by a divine being .
Secondly , any sensory experience that actually occurs while a person is asleep and is perceived by the person while asleep does not qualify as part of a dream .
Lastly , the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of sensory experiences had when awake .
Aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function -LRB- `` ergon '' -RRB- of a thing .
Aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action , `` eudaimonia '' , generally translated as `` happiness '' or sometimes `` well being '' .
He also famously stated that `` man is by nature a political animal '' and also arguing that humanity 's defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality .
Aristotle 's conception of the city is organic , and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner .
This is distinguished from modern approaches , beginning with social contract theory , according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of `` fear of violent death '' or its `` inconveniences . ''
The forms also differ in their object of imitation .
