Anarchism
Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates self-governed societies with voluntary institutions .
There are many types and traditions of anarchism , not all of which are mutually exclusive .
Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications .
from the privative prefix ἀν - -LRB- `` an - '' , i.e. `` without '' -RRB- and , `` archos '' , i.e. `` leader '' , `` ruler '' ;
History .
Origins .
The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century BC , among the works of Taoist philosopher Laozi , and in later centuries by Zhuangzi and Bao Jingyan .
In early Islamic history , some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the Islamic civil war over the Caliphate , where the Kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the Islamic society .
The radical Protestant Christian Gerrard Winstanley and his group the Diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England .
By the time of the French Revolution some , such as the `` Enragés '' , began to use the term positively , in opposition to Jacobin centralisation of power , seeing `` revolutionary government '' as oxymoronic .
He argued in `` Political Justice '' -LRB- 1793 -RRB- that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society , and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance .
He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation .
, '' published in 1840 .
It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory .
his famous quote on the matter is , `` Liberty is the mother , not the daughter , of order . ''
In this work , he opposed the institution of decreed `` property '' -LRB- `` propriété '' -RRB- , where owners have complete rights to `` use and abuse '' their property as they wish .
French anarchists active in the 1848 Revolution included Anselme Bellegarrigue , Ernest Coeurderoy , Joseph Déjacque and Pierre Joseph Proudhon .
After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure , conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists , anarchists , liberals , and nationalists , to prevent further revolt .
According to George Woodcock `` These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870 , but before that time Proudhonian ideas , as interpreted by Pi , already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860 's . ''
A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism -LRB- or trade unionism -RRB- .
Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue , as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution , while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient .
By the 1880s , people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan , `` propaganda of the deed '' to refer to individual bombings , regicides , and tyrannicides .
A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action , for example through the trade union movement .
State repression -LRB- including the infamous 1894 French `` lois scélérates '' -RRB- of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics , although reciprocally state repression , in the first place , may have played a role in these isolated acts .
In Paris , the Dielo Truda group of Russian anarchist exiles , which included Nestor Makhno , concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism .
Their 1926 manifesto , called the `` Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists -LRB- Draft -RRB- '' , was supported .
Synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives .
In France , where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots , anarchists divided over a united front policy .
Anarchists in France and Italy were active in the Resistance during World War II .
Joseph Goebbels , the Nazi propaganda minister , labelled him as one of `` those Jewish subversives . ''
On 2 February 1934 , Mühsam was transferred to the concentration camp at Oranienburg when finally on the night of 9 July 1934 , Mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards , his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning .
Post-war years .
Anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of Italy and France .
Korean anarchists formed the League of Free Social Constructors in September 1945 and in 1946 the Japanese Anarchist Federation was founded .
The Federation of Libertarian Socialists was founded in Germany in 1947 and Rudolf Rocker wrote for its organ , `` Die Freie Gesellschaft '' , which survived until 1953 .
Anarcho-pacifism became a `` basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War . ''
Contemporary anarchism .
A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s .
Anarchism was influential in the Counterculture of the 1960s and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts .
In the United Kingdom in the 1970s this was associated with the punk rock movement , as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols .
Since the revival of anarchism in the mid 20th century , a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged .
Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha-feminism , they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s .
Around the turn of the 21st century , anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war , anti-capitalist , and anti-globalisation movements .
Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting , property destruction , and violent confrontations with police .
other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture , affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet .
it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality , impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally . ''
The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain , in the form of the Confederación General del Trabajo -LRB- CGT -RRB- and the CNT .
The revolutionary industrial unionist Industrial Workers of the World , claiming 3,000 paying members , and the International Workers Association , an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International , also remain active .
In a chronological and theoretical sense , there are classical -- those created throughout the 19th century -- and post-classical anarchist schools -- those created since the mid-20th century and after .
One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was `` anarchism without adjectives '' , a call for toleration first adopted by Fernando Tarrida del Mármol in 1889 in response to the `` bitter debates '' of anarchist theory at the time .
Mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity , free association , voluntary contract , federation , and credit and currency reform .
According to the American mutualist William Batchelder Greene , each worker in the mutualist system would receive `` just and exact pay for his work ;
services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost , without profit or discount . ''
Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism .
Proudhon first characterised his goal as a `` third form of society , the synthesis of communism and property . ''
In 1793 , William Godwin , who has often been cited as the first anarchist , wrote `` Political Justice '' , which some consider the first expression of anarchism .
An influential form of individualist anarchism , called `` egoism , '' or egoist anarchism , was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism , the German Max Stirner .
Josiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist , and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833 , `` The Peaceful Revolutionist '' , was the first anarchist periodical published .
These authors and activists included Oscar Wilde , Emile Armand , Han Ryner , Henri Zisly , Renzo Novatore , Miguel Gimenez Igualada , Adolf Brand and Lev Chernyi among others .
Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production , instead advocating that ownership be collectivised .
This position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively `` uphold -LSB- ing -RSB- the wages system '' .
Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with Marxism but opposed the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat , despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society .
Anarcho-communism .
Anarchist communism -LRB- also known as anarcho-communism , libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism -RRB- is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state , markets , money , private property -LRB- while retaining respect for personal property -RRB- , and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production , direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers ' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle : `` from each according to his ability , to each according to his need '' .
In Argentina anarcha-feminist Virginia Bolten published the newspaper called '' '' -LRB- English : The Woman 's Voice -RRB- , which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897 , and was revived , briefly , in 1901 .
Education for him is to create `` free men , sovereign characters , '' by which he means `` eternal characters ... who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment '' .
In 1901 , Catalan anarchist and free-thinker Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia established `` modern '' or progressive schools in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church .
La Escuela Moderna , and Ferrer 's ideas generally , formed the inspiration for a series of `` Modern Schools '' in the United States , Cuba , South America and London .
Tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture .
-LSB- Education is -RSB- when the teaching is forced upon the pupil , and when then instruction is exclusive , that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary '' .
European history professor Carl Landauer , in his book `` European Socialism '' argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a `` lesser evil '' than a society without `` repressive force . ''
People with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal , or even superior , in others .
impairments in communication ;
and restricted interests and repetitive behavior .
Other aspects , such as atypical eating , are also common but are not essential for diagnosis .
Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood .
Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli , smile and look at others less often , and respond less to their own name .
However , they do form attachments to their primary caregivers .
Most childen with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children , although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD .
As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills , these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends .
Other symptoms .
An estimated 0.5 % to 10 % of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities , ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants .
An estimated 60 % -- 80 % of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone , poor motor planning , and toe walking ;
Selectivity is the most common problem , although eating rituals and food refusal also occur ;
this does not appear to result in malnutrition .
studies report conflicting results , and the relationship between gastrointestinal problems and ASD is unclear .
Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with Down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship .

it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways , or is -LRB- like intellectual disability -RRB- a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms .
It is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all children with autism .
Hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following :
Children with autism have been found by researchers to have inflammation of both the peripheral and central immune systems as indicated by increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and significant activation of microglia .
06: peripheral-15 JJ -> NN
However , individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the MNS and the MNS theory does not explain the normal performance of children with autism on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object .
The underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high-level neural connections and synchronization , along with an excess of low-level processes .
Other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex .
several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli .
For example , magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in children with autism of delayed responses in the brain 's processing of auditory signals .
research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with 1q21 .1 deletion syndrome .
Neuropsychology .
Two major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior .
The first category focuses on deficits in social cognition .
Simon Baron-Cohen 's empathizing -- systemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemize -- that is , they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain -- but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents .
Diagnosis .
Diagnosis is based on behavior , not cause or mechanism .
Under the DSM-5 , autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts , as well as restricted , repetitive patterns of behavior , interests , or activities .
A differential diagnosis for ASD at this stage might also consider intellectual disability , hearing impairment , and a specific language impairment such as Landau -- Kleffner syndrome .
Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results , given the complexity of autism 's genetics .
Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood , they are sometimes missed ;
Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases , and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices .
These symptoms do not imply sickness , fragility , or emotional disturbance .
Of the five PDD forms , Asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes ;
PDD not otherwise specified -LRB- PDD-NOS ;
also called `` atypical autism '' -RRB- is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder .
ASD , in turn , is a subset of the broader autism phenotype , which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits , such as avoiding eye contact .
The validity of this distinction remains controversial ;
it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype , or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression .
Newer technologies such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes -LRB- observable traits -RRB- that can be viewed on brain scans , to help further neurogenetic studies of autism ;
In contrast , in the UK , children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened .
Screening tools include the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers -LRB- M-CHAT -RRB- , the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire , and the First Year Inventory ;
Among these approaches , interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively , or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit .
Two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include applied behavioral analysis -LRB- ABA -RRB- and developmental social pragmatic models -LRB- DSP -RRB- .
One interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model , which teaches parents how to implement various ABA and DSP techniques , allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves .
Education .
Educational interventions can be effective to varying degrees in most children : intensive ABA treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children and is well-established for improving intellectual performance of young children .
The appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers .
Antipsychotics , such as risperidone and aripiprazole , have been found to be useful for treating irritability , repetitive behavior , and sleeplessness that often occurs with autism .
Some alternative treatments may place the child at risk .
A 2008 study found that compared to their peers , autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on casein-free diets ;
one 2008 US study found a 14 % average loss of annual income in families of children with ASD , and a related study found that ASD is associated with higher probability that child care problems will greatly affect parental employment .
Most children with autism lack social support , meaningful relationships , future employment opportunities or self-determination .
Although core difficulties tend to persist , symptoms often become less severe with age .
independent living is unlikely with severe autism .
Epidemiology .
Most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of 1 -- 2 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for ASD , and 11 per 1,000 children in the United States for ASD as of 2008 ;
The word `` autism '' first took its modern sense in 1938 when Hans Asperger of the Vienna University Hospital adopted Bleuler 's terminology `` autistic psychopaths '' in a lecture in German about child psychology .
Kanner 's reuse of `` autism '' led to decades of confused terminology like `` infantile schizophrenia '' , and child psychiatry 's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant 's response to `` refrigerator mothers '' .
In practice , a bidirectional reflectance distribution function -LRB- BRDF -RRB- may be required to accurately characterize the scattering properties of a surface , but albedo is very useful as a first approximation .
Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body .
When seen from a distance , the ocean surface has a low albedo , as do most forests , whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms .
If Earth were frozen entirely -LRB- and hence be more reflective -RRB- the average temperature of the planet would drop below − 40 ° C .
Albedo formula_4 can then be given as :
Directional-hemispherical reflectance is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and bi-hemispherical reflectance as white-sky albedo .
Astronomical albedo .
The albedos of planets , satellites and asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties .
The study of albedos , their dependence on wavelength , lighting angle -LRB- `` phase angle '' -RRB- , and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry .
The overall albedo of the Moon is around 0.12 , but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian , displaying also a strong opposition effect .
The correlation between astronomical -LRB- geometric -RRB- albedo , absolute magnitude and diameter is :
Examples of terrestrial albedo effects .
Illumination .
Although the albedo -- temperature effect is best known in colder , whiter regions on Earth , the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year-round illumination is greater .
high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation , where areas such as the Sahara Desert , which also have a relatively high albedo , will be hotter due to high insolation .
When an area 's albedo changes due to snowfall , a snow -- temperature feedback results .
However , because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons , eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight -LRB- higher insolation -RRB- cause melting .
Cryoconite , powdery windblown dust containing soot , sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets .
Hence , small errors in albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates , which is why it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value over broad regions .
In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect .
Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration .
The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface , causes heating where it condenses , acts a strong greenhouse gas , and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact , and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate
Human activities .
Human activities -LRB- e.g. deforestation , farming , and urbanization -RRB- change the albedo of various areas around the globe .
However , quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult .
It depends on properties of the material -LRB- refractive index -RRB- ;
and the wavelength of the incoming radiation .
It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter alpha , from which it derives .
The upper-case version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle , crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar .
The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it , especially fonts intended to be read by children .
In turn , the origin of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto-Sinaitic script influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphs , styled as a triangular head with two horns extended .
In 1600 B.C.E. , the Phoenician alphabet 's letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms .
The Etruscans brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the Italian Peninsula and left the letter unchanged .
The Romans later adopted the Etruscan alphabet to write the Latin language , and the resulting letter was preserved in the Latin alphabet used to write many languages , including English .
For perishable surfaces , which were used for everyday or utilitarian purposes , a cursive style was used .
Due to the `` perishable '' nature of the surfaces , examples of this style are not as common as those of the monumental .
At the end of the Roman Empire -LRB- 5th century AD -RRB- , several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe .
07: cursive-18 VBP -> NN
This form was derived through a combining of prior forms .
07: combine-7 VBG -> NN
15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today .
These variants , the `` Italic '' and `` Roman '' forms , were derived from the Caroline Script version .
The Italic form used in most current handwriting consists of a circle and vertical stroke , called Latin alpha or `` script a '' .
Most printed material uses the Roman form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it .
Both derive from the majuscule -LRB- capital -RRB- form .
In Greek handwriting , it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop , as demonstrated by the uncial version shown .
However , occurs in many common digraphs , all with their own sound or sounds , particularly , , , , and .
In one study , on average , about 3.68 % of letters used in English texts tend to be , while the number is 6.22 % in Spanish and 3.95 % in French .
In geometry , capital A , B , C etc. are used to denote segments , lines , rays , etc. .
In physics , A is the SI unit symbol for Ampere .

`` A grade '' for clean restaurants ;
A-list celebrities , etc. .
Such associations can have a motivating effect , as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance , when compared with other letters .
Alabama
Alabama is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States .
It is bordered by Tennessee to the north , Georgia to the east , Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south , and Mississippi to the west .
From the American Civil War until World War II , Alabama , like many Southern states , suffered economic hardship , in part because of continued dependence on agriculture .
urban interests and African Americans were markedly under-represented .
African Americans and poor whites were essentially disenfranchised altogether by the state constitution of 1901 , a status that continued into the mid-1960s before being alleviated by federal legislation .
The power of the Solid South in Congress gained the establishment or expansion of multiple United States Armed Forces installations , which helped to bridge the gap between an agricultural and industrial economy during the mid-20th century .
the plural form is `` Albaamaha '' -RRB- .
The word `` Alabama '' is believed to have come from the related Choctaw language and was adopted by the Alabama tribe as their name .
Sources disagree on the meaning of the word .
An 1842 article in the `` Jacksonville Republican '' proposed that it meant `` Here We Rest . ''
This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of Alexander Beaufort Meek .
09: popularize-4 VBD -> VBN
Experts in the Muskogean languages have been unable to find any evidence to support such a translation .
The meaning may have been `` clearers of the thicket '' or `` herb gatherers '' , referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants .
The agrarian Mississippian culture covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 AD , with one of its major centers built at what is now the Moundville Archaeological Site in Moundville , Alabama .
The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples ;
Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in the area of present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were the Cherokee , an Iroquoian language people ;
Thomas Bassett , a loyalist to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era , was one of the earliest White settlers in the state outside Mobile .
Most of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was known as the Yazoo lands beginning during the British colonial period .
With the exception of the area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands , what is now the lower one-third Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory when it was organized in 1798 .
The Alabama Territory was created by the United States Congress on March 3 , 1817 .
St. Stephens , now abandoned , served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819 .
The U.S. Congress selected Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention of Alabama after it was approved to become the 22nd state .
Alabama Fever was already underway when the state was admitted to the Union , with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation .
The Confederacy 's capital was initially located at Montgomery .
Alabama was heavily involved in the American Civil War .
Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state , Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the war effort .
Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African-American congressmen : Jeremiah Haralson , Benjamin S. Turner , and James T. Rapier .
Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects , although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation .
They wrote another constitution in 1875 , and the legislature passed the Blaine Amendment , prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools .
20th century .
The new 1901 Constitution of Alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population , including nearly all African Americans and Native Americans , and tens of thousands of poor whites , through making voter registration difficult , requiring a poll taxes and literacy test .
A class action suit initiated on behalf of plaintiffs in Lowndes County , Alabama challenged the state legislature 's lack of redistricting for congressional seats .
In 1972 , for the first time since 1901 , the legislature completed the first congressional redistricting based on the decennial census .
Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts .
African Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the Civil Rights Movement , including legal challenges .
These contributed to Congressional passage and enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 by the U.S. Congress .
There is very limited home rule , but the legislature is deeply involved in passing legislation that applies to county-level functions and policies .
At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county , as the majority tended to take all seats .
As part of settlement of this case , five Alabama cites and counties , including Chilton County , adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions .
About three-fifths of the land area is a gentle plain with a general descent towards the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico .
The North Alabama region is mostly mountainous , with the Tennessee River cutting a large valley and creating numerous creeks , streams , rivers , mountains , and lakes .
The state ranges in elevation from sea level at Mobile Bay to over 1,800 feet -LRB- 550 m -RRB- in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast .

Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico , while the northern parts of the state , especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast , tend to be slightly cooler .
The tally reached 62 .
The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state .
Winters are generally mild in Alabama , as they are throughout most of the southeastern U.S. , with average January low temperatures around in Mobile and around in Birmingham .
The record low of occurred on January 30 , 1966 in New Market .
It currently ranks fifth in the nation for the diversity of its flora .
Invertebrates include 83 crayfish species and 383 mollusk species .
113 of these mollusk species have never been collected outside the state .
This includes a natural increase since the last census of 121,054 people -LRB- that is 502,457 births minus 381,403 deaths -RRB- and an increase due to net migration of 104,991 people into the state .
The state had 108,000 foreign-born -LRB- 2.4 % of the state population -RRB- , of which an estimated 22.2 % were illegal immigrants -LRB- 24,000 -RRB- .
The largest reported ancestry groups in Alabama are : African American -LRB- 26.2 % -RRB- , English -LRB- 23.6 % -RRB- , Irish -LRB- 7.7 % -RRB- , German -LRB- 5.7 % -RRB- , and Scots-Irish -LRB- 2.0 % -RRB- .
The Scots-Irish were the largest non-English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution , and many settled in the South , later moving into the Deep South as it was developed .
The state has officially recognized nine American Indian tribes in the state , descended mostly from the Five Civilized Tribes of the American Southeast .
Alabama English is predominantly Southern , and is related to South Midland speech which was taken across the border from Tennessee .
In the northern third of the state , there is a South Midland ` arm ' and ` barb ' rhyming with ` form ' and ` orb . '
Religion .
In the 2008 American Religious Identification Survey , 86 % of Alabama respondents reported their religion as Christian , including 6 % Catholic , and 11 % as having no religion .
06: catholic-23 JJ -> NN
, the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are the Southern Baptist Convention , The United Methodist Church , and non-denominational Evangelical Protestant .
The Presbyterian churches , strongly associated with Scots-Irish immigrants of the 18th century and their descendants , had a combined membership around 75,000 -LRB- PCA-28 ,009 members in 108 congregations , PC -LRB- USA -RRB- -26,247 members in 147 congregations , the Cumberland Presbyterian Church-6 ,000 members in 59 congregations , the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America-5 ,000 members and 50 congregations plus the EPC and Associate Reformed Presbyterians with 230 members and 9 congregations -RRB- .
Alabama 's income tax on poor working families is among the highest in the United States .
Alabama 's threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes .
The overall federal , state , and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country .
The state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties , as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission .
On November 9 , 2011 , Jefferson County , which was $ 4 billion in debt at the time , declared bankruptcy .
Twenty-five of the 67 counties are `` dry counties '' which ban the sale of alcohol , and there are many dry municipalities even in counties which permit alcohol sales .
As counties were the basis of election districts , the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century , until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation .
Since the mid to late-20th century , however , there has been a realignment among the two major political parties , and white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party .
Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court .
Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the Alabama State Board of Education .
The last remaining statewide Democrat , who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in 2012 .
Many rural counties have voters who are majority Democrats , resulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary .
Similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority-Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary , although there are exceptions .

Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund .
In 2007 , over 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress -LRB- AYP -RRB- toward student proficiency under the National No Child Left Behind law , using measures determined by the state of Alabama .
Accreditation of academic programs is through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools -LRB- SACS -RRB- as well as other subject-focused national and international accreditation agencies such as the Association for Biblical Higher Education -LRB- ABHE -RRB- , the Council on Occupational Education -LRB- COE -RRB- , and the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools -LRB- ACICS -RRB- .

His mother was the nymph Thetis , and his father , Peleus , was the king of the Myrmidons .
Achilles ' most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero Hector outside the gates of Troy .
Because of his death from a small wound in the heel , the term `` Achilles ' heel '' has come to mean a person 's point of weakness .
In other words , Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people , grief being a theme raised numerous times in the `` Iliad '' -LRB- frequently by Achilles -RRB- .
It was also turned into the female form Ἀχιλλεία -LRB- `` Achilleía '' -RRB- attested in Attica in the 4th century BC -LRB- IG II ² 1617 -RRB- and , in the form `` Achillia '' , on a stele in Halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an `` Amazon '' .
therefore , the spear must be able to heal it .
Troilus .
According to the `` Cypria '' -LRB- the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles ' Wrath -RRB- , when the Achaeans desired to return home , they were restrained by Achilles , who afterwards attacked the cattle of Aeneas , sacked neighboring cities and killed Troilus .
Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches , but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy .
The new armor includes the Shield of Achilles , described in great detail in the poem .
Enraged over the death of Patroclus , Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector .
Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him , declaring that `` my rage , my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw -- such agonies you have caused me '' .
The episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic `` Aethiopis '' , which was composed after the `` Iliad '' , possibly in the 7th century B.C. .
Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena 's hand in marriage .
Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world 's greatest warrior .
Paris was later killed by Philoctetes using the enormous bow of Heracles .
Furious , Ajax cursed Odysseus , which earned the ire of Athena .
Athena temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep , thinking them his comrades .
Odysseus eventually gave the armor to Neoptolemus , the son of Achilles .
A relic claimed to be Achilles ' bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of Phaselis , Lycia , a port on the Pamphylian Gulf .
Homer does not suggest that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus were lovers .
Commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures .
Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover .
Pliny 's `` Natural History '' mentions a tumulus that is no longer evident -LRB- `` Insula Akchillis tumulo eius viri clara '' -RRB- , on the island consecrated to him , located at a distance of fifty Roman miles from Peuce by the Danube Delta , and the temple there .
Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing .
Pausanias -LRB- III .19,13 -RRB- reports that the Delphic Pythia sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound .
The palace , naturally , was named after Achilles : `` Achilleion '' -LRB- Αχίλλειον -RRB- .
This elegant structure abounds with paintings and statues of Achilles both in the main hall and in the lavish gardens depicting the heroic and tragic scenes of the Trojan war .
Other stories .
Some post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war , Thetis -LRB- or , in some versions , Peleus -RRB- hides the young man at the court of Lycomedes , king of Skyros .
This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life .
Achilles was worshipped as a sea-god in many of the Greek colonies on the Black Sea , the location of the mythical `` White Island '' which he was said to inhabit after his death , together with many other heroes .
Achilles in Greek philosophy .
The philosopher Zeno of Elea centered one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between `` swift-footed '' Achilles and a tortoise , by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start , and therefore that motion and change were impossible .
In 1858 , while taking part in a series of highly publicized debates with his opponent and rival , Democrat Stephen A. Douglas , Lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery , but lost the U.S. Senate race to Douglas .
His Gettysburg Address became an iconic endorsement of the principles of nationalism , republicanism , equal rights , liberty , and democracy .
Lincoln closely supervised the war effort , especially the selection of top generals , including his most successful general , Ulysses S. Grant .
Lincoln tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond ;
each time a general failed , Lincoln substituted another , until finally Grant succeeded .
As the war progressed , his complex moves toward ending slavery began with the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 ;
subsequently , Lincoln used the U.S. Army to protect escaped slaves , encouraged the border states to outlaw slavery , and pushed through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which permanently outlawed slavery .
Lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as one of the three greatest U.S. presidents .
He is a descendant of Samuel Lincoln , who migrated from Norfolk , England to Hingham , Massachusetts , in 1638 .
Samuel 's grandson and great-grandson began the family 's western migration , which passed through New Jersey , Pennsylvania , and Virginia .
Lincoln 's mother , Nancy , was the daughter of Lucy Shipley Hanks , and was born in what is now Mineral County , West Virginia , then part of Virginia .
however , a land title dispute soon forced the Lincolns to move .
In 1811 the family relocated eight miles north , to Knob Creek Farm , where Thomas acquired title to of land .
Frustrated over the lack of security provided by Kentucky courts , Thomas sold the remaining land he held in Kentucky in 1814 , and began planning a move to Indiana , where the land survey process was more reliable and the ability for an individual to retain land titles was more secure .
Later that spring , Denton Offutt , a New Salem merchant , hired Lincoln and some friends to take goods by flatboat from New Salem to New Orleans via the Sangamon , Illinois , and Mississippi rivers .
Lincoln `` was remarkably fond of children '' , and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their children .
Lincoln 's father-in-law and others of the Todd family were either slave owners or slave traders .
Early career and militia service .
In 1832 , at age 23 , Lincoln and a partner bought a small general store on credit in New Salem , Illinois .
Before the election , Lincoln served as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the Black Hawk War .
Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates -LRB- the top four were elected -RRB- , though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct .
Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and closing arguments .
Successful on his second run for office , Lincoln served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a Whig representative from Sangamon County .
He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation , but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line .
The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico and the U.S. Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had `` invaded `` our territory '' and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our `` own soil '' .
As a riverboat man , Lincoln initially favored those interests , but ultimately represented whoever hired him .
In 1849 , he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water .
the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer , superior , and less expensive route , and the corporation retained the right to demand Barret 's payment .
After an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight , Lincoln produced a `` Farmers ' Almanac '' showing the moon was at a low angle , drastically reducing visibility .
Lincoln disapproved of slavery , and the spread of slavery to new U.S. territory in the west .
He returned to politics to oppose the pro-slavery Kansas -- Nebraska Act -LRB- 1854 -RRB- ;
this law repealed the slavery-restricting Missouri Compromise -LRB- 1820 -RRB- .
Douglas ' provision , which Lincoln opposed , specified settlers had the right to determine locally whether to allow slavery in new U.S. territory , rather than have such a decision restricted by the national Congress .
After leading in the first six rounds of voting in the Illinois assembly , his support began to dwindle , and Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for Lyman Trumbull , who defeated opponent Joel Aldrich Matteson .
Lincoln argued , `` The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended ` to say all were equal in color , size , intellect , moral developments , or social capacity ' , but they ` did consider all men created equal -- equal in certain inalienable rights , among which are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ' . ''
The Republican Party 's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition ;
a `` Chicago Tribune '' writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln 's life , and sold 100,000 to 200,000 copies .
He was the first president from the Republican Party .
His victory was entirely due to the strength of his support in the North and West ;
Turnout was 82.2 percent , with Lincoln winning the free Northern states , as well as California and Oregon .
Although Lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote , his victory in the electoral college was decisive : Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123 .
The Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its provisional President on February 9 , 1861 .
Lincoln , however , did tacitly support the proposed Corwin Amendment to the Constitution , which passed Congress before Lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states .
Lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the Constitution .
The president-elect then evaded possible assassins in Baltimore , who were uncovered by Lincoln 's head of security , Allan Pinkerton .
We must not be enemies ... The mystic chords of memory , stretching from every battlefield , and patriot grave , to every living heart and hearthstone , all over this broad land , will yet swell the chorus of the Union , when again touched , as surely they will be , by the better angels of our nature . ''
Frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the Department of the West compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption .
Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered .
Lincoln 's foreign policy approach had been initially hands off , due to his inexperience ;
To learn technical military terms , Lincoln borrowed and studied Henry Halleck 's book , `` Elements of Military Art and Science '' from the Library of Congress .
Stanton was a staunchly Unionist pro-business conservative Democrat who moved toward the Radical Republican faction .
Nevertheless , he worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than any other senior official .
major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days .
Twice a week , Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon , and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard .
The campaign 's objective was to capture Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital .
McClellan 's letter incensed Radical Republicans , who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint John Pope , a Republican , as head of the new Army of Virginia .
Two days after McClellan 's return to command , General Robert E. Lee 's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland , leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862 .
The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history , but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January .
McClellan then resisted the President 's demand that he pursue Lee 's retreating and exposed army , while his counterpart General Don Carlos Buell likewise refused orders to move the Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee .
these plans included Hooker 's attack on Lee north of Richmond , Rosecrans ' on Chattanooga , Grant 's on Vicksburg , and a naval assault on Charleston .
He was replaced by George Meade , who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign , which was a victory for the Union , though Lee 's army avoided capture .
Even so , he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander-in-Chief .
He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory .
Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it , as envisioned by the Founding Fathers , under the constitution .
In July 1862 , the Second Confiscation Act was passed , which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion .
In that month , Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet .
Privately , Lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the Confederacy had to be eliminated .
However Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification .
Although he said he personally wished all men could be free , Lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as the U.S. president -LRB- he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his `` official duty '' -RRB- was that of preserving the Union :
He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation , but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed .
In a letter to Andrew Johnson , the military governor of Tennessee , encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops , Lincoln wrote , `` The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once '' .
He obtained Congress 's consent to reinstate for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General , which no officer had held since George Washington .
Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive , the Confederate forces had `` almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces '' .
Grant 's army moved south , crossed the James River , forcing a siege and trench warfare outside Petersburg , Virginia .
Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure -- such as plantations , railroads , and bridges -- hoping to destroy the South 's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting .
Mark E. Neely Jr. has argued that there was no effort to engage in `` total war '' against civilians which he believed did take place during World War II .
On April 1 , 1865 , Grant successfully outflanked Lee 's forces in the Battle of Five Forks and nearly encircled Petersburg , and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond .
Sharing this fear , Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that , if he should lose the election , he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House :
the Democratic Party was deeply split , with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln .
On March 4 , 1865 , Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address .
In it , he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be God 's will .
Historian Mark Noll concludes it ranks `` among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world '' .
Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South , Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war .
Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas , where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors , respectively .
Lincoln 's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans ' political aspirations .
To fill Chief Justice Taney 's seat on the Supreme Court , he named the choice of the Radicals , Salmon P. Chase , who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies .
Historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what Lincoln would have done about Reconstruction if he had lived , but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen .
Nevertheless , in 1861 , Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms -LRB- the Constitution was a contract , and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree -RRB- , and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state .
In 1864 , Booth formulated a plan -LRB- very similar to one of Thomas N. Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy -RRB- to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners .
Having determined that the President had been shot in the head , and not stabbed in the shoulder as originally thought , he made an attempt to clear the blood clot , after which the President began to breathe more naturally .
Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs .
However he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and , by 1865 , was expressing those beliefs in major speeches .
The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace .
Yet the contest proceeds . ''
On the day Lincoln was assassinated , he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the Holy Land .
A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one , while legal scholars placed him second after Washington .
Lincoln ;
2 .
George Washington ;
and 3 .
Franklin D. Roosevelt , although Lincoln and Washington , and Washington and Roosevelt , are occasionally reversed .
Schwartz argues that Lincoln 's reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the Progressive Era -LRB- 1900 -- 1920s -RRB- when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in American history , with even white Southerners in agreement .
As a Whig activist , Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests , favoring high tariffs , banks , internal improvements , and railroads in opposition to the agrarian Democrats .
James G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation `` in his preference for orderly progress , his distrust of dangerous agitation , and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform '' .
Randall concludes that , `` he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called ` radicalism ' which involved abuse of the South , hatred for the slaveholder , thirst for vengeance , partisan plotting , and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders .

At eighteen , he joined Plato 's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven -LRB- c. 347 BC -RRB- .
According to the `` Encyclopædia Britannica '' , `` Aristotle was the first genuine scientist in history ... -LSB- and -RSB- every scientist is in his debt . ''
Aristotle 's views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship .
His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic , which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern formal logic .
Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as `` The First Teacher '' .
His ethics , though always influential , gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics .
Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues -- Cicero described his literary style as `` a river of gold '' -- it is thought that only around a third of his original output has survived .
Aristotle married Pythias , either Hermias 's adoptive daughter or niece .
Soon after Hermias ' death , Aristotle was invited by Philip II of Macedon to become the tutor to his son Alexander in 343 BC .
Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years .
While in Athens , his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with Herpyllis of Stagira , who bore him a son whom he named after his father , Nicomachus .
He also studied education , foreign customs , literature and poetry .
His combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of Greek knowledge .
A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander 's death , but there is little evidence .
He died in Euboea of natural causes later that same year , having named his student Antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife .
Kant stated in the `` Critique of Pure Reason '' that Aristotle 's theory of logic completely accounted for the core of deductive inference .
History .
Aristotle `` says that ` on the subject of reasoning ' he ` had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of ' '' .
Even Plato had difficulties with logic ;
although he had a reasonable conception of a deductive system , he could never actually construct one , thus he relied instead on his dialectic .
Analytics and the `` Organon '' .
What we today call `` Aristotelian logic '' , Aristotle himself would have labeled `` analytics '' .
The term `` logic '' he reserved to mean `` dialectics '' .
Most of Aristotle 's work is probably not in its original form , because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers .
The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory `` stricto sensu '' : the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning .
There is one volume of Aristotle 's concerning logic not found in the `` Organon '' , namely the fourth book of `` Metaphysics . ''
For Aristotle , `` form '' still refers to the unconditional basis of phenomena but is `` instantiated '' in a particular substance -LRB- see `` Universals and particulars '' , below -RRB- .
In a certain sense , Aristotle 's method is both inductive and deductive , while Plato 's is essentially deductive from `` a priori '' principles .
Today 's philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the scientific method .
In contrast , Aristotle 's philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry .
In the larger sense of the word , Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning , which he also would describe as `` science '' .
Note , however , that his use of the term `` science '' carries a different meaning than that covered by the term `` scientific method '' .
by theoretical science , he means physics , mathematics and metaphysics .
-LRB- 3 -RRB- Practical Philosophy and -LRB- 4 -RRB- Poetical Philosophy .
In fact , most of Aristotle 's life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science .
Aristotle 's writings on science are largely qualitative , as opposed to quantitative .
Beginning in the 16th century , scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences , and Aristotle 's work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate .
For example , in his `` History of Animals '' he claimed that human males have more teeth than females .
On the other hand , Aristotle refuted Democritus 's claim that the Milky Way was made up of `` those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun 's rays , '' pointing out -LRB- correctly , even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time -RRB- that , given `` current astronomical demonstrations '' that `` the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun , then ... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them . ''
Though a few ancient atomists such as Lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life , teleology -LRB- and after the rise of Christianity , natural theology -RRB- would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries .
Aristotle believed an `` imprint '' becomes impressed on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory .
A memory occurs when a stimuli is too complex that the nervous system -LRB- semi-fluid bodily organ -RRB- can not receive all the impressions at once .
These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation , common sense , and thinking .
It does not matter if the experience was seen or heard , every experience ends up as a mental image in memory
These abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after a lapse of time .
The retrieval of our `` imprints '' can not be performed suddenly .
Aristotle proposed that slow-witted people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences and so the `` imprint '' can easily continue .
In order to search for these `` imprints '' , people search the memory itself .
Within the memory , if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory , that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for .
Only humans will remember `` imprints '' of intellectual activity , such as numbers and words .
Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed .
These three laws make up his Laws of Association .
Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind .
A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience .
Dreams .
Sleep .
Before understanding Aristotle 's take on dreams , first his idea of sleep must be examined .
Sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses or of digestion , so it is vital to the body , including the senses , so it can be revitalized .
When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly , a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions left from previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant .
One component of Aristotle 's theory of dreams introduces ideas that are contradictory to previously held beliefs .
These ideas were contradictory to what had been believed about dreams , but at the time in which he introduced these ideas more thinkers were beginning to give naturalistic as opposed to supernatural explanations to phenomena .
Aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately , but by teachers , and experience , leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things .
Excerpt from a speech by the character ` Aristotle ' in the book Protrepticus -LRB- Hutchinson and Johnson , 2015 p. 22 -RRB-
