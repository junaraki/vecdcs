These are often described as stateless societies , but several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-hierarchical free associations .
The first known use of this word was in 1539 .
Various factions within the French Revolution labelled opponents as anarchists -LRB- as Robespierre did the Hébertists -RRB- although few shared many views of later anarchists .
The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon , marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century .
its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States .
On the other hand , some use `` libertarianism '' to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only , referring to free-market anarchism as `` libertarian anarchism '' .
Zhuangzi 's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist .
Zhuangzi wrote , `` A petty thief is put in jail .
A great brigand becomes a ruler of a Nation . ''
Jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the Christian anarchist tradition .
Georges Lechartier wrote that `` The true founder of anarchy was Jesus Christ and ... the first anarchist society was that of the apostles . ''
But such interpretations reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic Taoist teachings and that of other anti-authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not anarchism and religion are compatible .
Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as ` philosophical anarchism ' .
He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force .
The French Pierre-Joseph Proudhon is regarded as the first `` self-proclaimed '' anarchist , a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work , `` What is Property ?
He developed the theory of spontaneous order in society , where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests ;
Later , however , Proudhon added that `` Property is Liberty , '' and argued that it was a bulwark against state power .
Unlike Pierre-Joseph Proudhon , he argued that , `` it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to , but to the satisfaction of his or her needs , whatever may be their nature . ''
Due to its links to active workers ' movements , the International became a significant organisation .
Karl Marx became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council .
Proudhon 's followers , the mutualists , opposed Marx 's state socialism , advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings .
In 1868 , following their unsuccessful participation in the League of Peace and Freedom -LRB- LPF -RRB- , Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the First International -LRB- which had decided not to get involved with the LPF -RRB- .
In response , the federalist sections formed their own International at the St. Imier Congress , adopting a revolutionary anarchist program .
The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War .
In 1886 , the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions -LRB- FOTLU -RRB- of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886 , as the date by which the eight-hour work day would become standard .
Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself , whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it .
In Latin America in particular `` The anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America , and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in Mexico , Brazil , Peru , Chile , and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook ;
There , in the Free Territory , they fought in the civil war against the Whites -LRB- a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution -RRB- and then the Bolsheviks as part of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno , who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months .
Spanish Revolution .
In Spain , the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union Confederación Nacional del Trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance , and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory .
Much of Spain 's economy was put under worker control ;
in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia , the figure was as high as 75 % , but lower in areas with heavy Communist Party of Spain influence , as the Soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivization enactment .
In the early 1940s , the Antifascist International Solidarity and the Federation of Anarchist Groups of Cuba merged into the large national organisation Asociación Libertaria de Cuba -LRB- Cuban Libertarian Association -RRB- .
After World War II , an appeal in the `` Fraye Arbeter Shtime '' detailing the plight of German anarchists and called for Americans to support them .
Anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time , such as Albert Camus , Herbert Read , Paul Goodman , Dwight Macdonald , Allen Ginsberg , George Woodcock , Leopold Kohr , Julian Beck , John Cage and the French Surrealist group led by André Breton , which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the Fédération Anarchiste .
Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism , which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it .
In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms -LRB- i.e. collectivist - , communist - , mutualist -- and individualist-anarchism -RRB- , it sought to emphasise the anti-authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought .
It is important to recognize that Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance .
For this reason , much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance , Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with Anarchist but Socialist factions of workers movements and , in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives , promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service .
Social anarchism .
Social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations , without any government authority or coercion .
It is the largest school of thought in anarchism .
Social anarchism rejects private property , seeing it as a source of social inequality -LRB- while retaining respect for personal property -RRB- , and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid .
However , collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income , as workers would be paid according to time worked , rather than receiving goods being distributed `` according to need '' as in anarcho-communism .
Most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society .
Anarcho-communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the French revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International .
The theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organisationalist and insurrectionary anti-organisationalist sections .
During the Russian Revolution , anarchists such as Nestor Makhno worked to create and defend -- through the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine -- anarchist communism in the Free Territory of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921 .
Moreover , anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers ' organisations -LRB- the organisations that struggle against the wage system , which , in anarcho-syndicalist theory , will eventually form the basis of a new society -RRB- should be self-managing .
The International Workers Association is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries .
The Spanish Confederación Nacional del Trabajo played and still plays a major role in the Spanish labour movement .
Green anarchism -LRB- or eco-anarchism -RRB- is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasizes environmental issues , with an important precedent in anarcho-naturism , and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho-primitivism and social ecology .
Anarcho-pacifism is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change -LRB- see non-violence -RRB- .
Its main proponents included Leo Tolstoy , Dorothy Day , Ammon Hennacy , and Jacques Ellul .
The document was based on the experiences of Russian anarchists in the 1917 October Revolution , which led eventually to the victory of the Bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups .
It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations .
Influenced by the work of Max Stirner and by the Marxist Situationist International , post-left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation .
Anarcho-capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favour of individual sovereignty in a free market .
Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical anti-state libertarianism and individualist anarchism , drawing from Austrian School economics , study of law and economics , and public choice theory .
There is a strong current within anarchism which does not consider that anarcho-capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti-capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism incompatible with capitalist forms .
Topics of interest .
Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought , certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory .
Free love particularly stressed women 's rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women : for example , marriage laws and anti-birth control measures .
The most important American free love journal was `` Lucifer the Lightbearer '' -LRB- 1883 -- 1907 -RRB- edited by Moses Harman and Lois Waisbrooker , but also there existed Ezra Heywood and Angela Heywood 's `` The Word '' -LRB- 1872 -- 1890 , 1892 -- 1893 -RRB- .
The issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-hedonist philosopher Michel Onfray in such works as `` Théorie du corps amoureux : pour une érotique solaire '' -LRB- 2000 -RRB- and `` L'invention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques '' -LRB- 2002 -RRB- .
The term deschooling was popularised by Ivan Illich , who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead .
The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood , typically before age three .
for example , the vaccine hypotheses have been disproven .
how this occurs is not well understood .
It is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum -LRB- ASDs -RRB- , the other two being Asperger syndrome , which lacks delays in cognitive development and language , and pervasive developmental disorder , not otherwise specified -LRB- commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS -RRB- , which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met .
deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper .
Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD , to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator .
Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of stress .
However , they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome ;
Causes .
It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic , cognitive , and neural levels for autism 's characteristic triad of symptoms .
Studies of twins suggest that heritability is 0.7 for autism and as high as 0.9 for ASD , and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population .
Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination .
The latter theory was supported by a litigation-funded study that has since been shown to have been `` an elaborate fraud '' .
How autism occurs is not well understood .
Its mechanism can be divided into two areas : the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism , and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors .
Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems , and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product .
This anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors .
It seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization .
The immune system is thought to play an important role in autism .
Biomarkers of abnormal immune function have also been associated with increased impairments in behaviors that are characteristic of the core features of autism such as deficits in social interactions and communication .
Some data suggests neuronal overgrowth potentially related to an increase in several growth hormones or to impaired regulation of growth factor receptors .
The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action .
Several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in MNS regions of individuals with ASD , delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with Asperger syndrome , and a correlation between reduced MNS activity and severity of the syndrome in children with ASD .
The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the Sally -- Anne test for reasoning about others ' motivations , and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in `` Pathophysiology '' maps well to the hypothesis .
A genotype-first model of diagnosis has been proposed , which would routinely assess the genome 's copy number variations .
Metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful , but are not routine .
In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment , though few cases are handled that quickly in practice .
It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired , partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision , and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms .
these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial .
Autism can also be divided into syndromal and non-syndromal autism ;
the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms , such as tuberous sclerosis .
Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills , as opposed to a failure to make progress , typically from 15 to 30 months of age .
It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior .
Screening .
About half of parents of children with ASD notice their child 's unusual behaviors by age 18 months , and about four-fifths notice by age 24 months .
It is not known which approach is more effective .
initial data on M-CHAT and its predecessor , the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers -LRB- CHAT -RRB- , on children aged 18 -- 30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity -LRB- many false-negatives -RRB- but good specificity -LRB- few false-positives -RRB- .
There is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD .
Alternative medicine .
Although many alternative therapies and interventions are available , few are supported by scientific studies .
Scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing , training availability , and parent requests .
There has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatments in children with autism .
Publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child , and unreimbursed out-of-pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems ;

Social-science scholars have had an increased focused on studying those with autism in hopes to learn more about `` autism as a culture , transcultural comparisons ... and research on social movements . ''
The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s .
The available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism 's true prevalence has increased ;
Boys are at higher risk for ASD than girls .
The sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment : it may be close to 2:1 with intellectual disability and more than 5.5:1 without .
The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue , as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair 's marriage to gain Blair 's inheritance .
Leo Kanner of the Johns Hopkins Hospital first used `` autism '' in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label `` early infantile autism '' in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities .
Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have deeply affected how we view ASD , parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child 's autistic behavior is perceived negatively by others , and many primary care physicians and medical specialists still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research .
Enceladus , a moon of Saturn , has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System , with 99 % of EM radiation reflected .
Their values can differ significantly , which is a common source of confusion .
In detailed studies , the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five Hapke parameters which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle , including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces .
Essentially , for the driving of weather , there are two types of albedo regions on Earth : Land and ocean .
warm and wet , which form over tropical and sub-tropical oceans ;
and cold and wet , which form over temperate , polar and sub-polar oceans .
High pressure systems flow toward lower pressure , driving weather from north to south in the northern hemisphere , and south to north in the lower ;
Snow .
Snow albedo is highly variable , ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow , to about 0.4 for melting snow , and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow .
Solar photovoltaic effects .
Albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices .
For example , the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon -LRB- a-Si : H -RRB- and crystalline silicon -LRB- c-Si -RRB- - based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions .
Fresh ` black ' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection .
Clouds .
Cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures .
Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity , theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8 .
Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight , but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth . ''
A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10 ° C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies .
The lower-case version can be written in two forms : the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ .
It is also found in italic type .
History .
The earliest certain ancestor of `` A '' is aleph -LRB- also written ` aleph -RRB- , the first letter of the Phoenician alphabet -LRB- which consisted entirely of consonants , thereby being an abjad rather than a true alphabet -RRB- .

Many fonts then made the right leg vertical .
In some of these , the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc , resulting in the printed form , while in others it was dropped , resulting in the modern handwritten form .
In logic , A is used to signify the universal affirmative .
07: be-5 VBZ -> NNS
`` A '' is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status : A - , A or A + , the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students ' schoolwork ;

Contrary to popular belief , the SECC appears to have no direct links to Mesoamerican culture , but developed independently .
While part of the same large language family , the Muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages .
More than 160 years later , the French founded the first European settlement in the region at Old Mobile in 1702 .
The latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the Spanish garrison at Mobile to U.S. forces on April 13 , 1813 .

This led to them being greeted with `` Yellowhammer '' , and the name later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army .
Organized insurgent , resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans .
Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874 , when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor 's office through an election dominated by fraud and violence .
The numbers dropped even more in later decades .
While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting , the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well , due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax .
By the 1920s , Birmingham was the 19th-largest city in the United States and had more than 30 % of the state 's population .
Beginning in the 1940s , when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters , the Alabama legislature took several counter - steps designed to disfranchise black voters .
One example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile .
Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base .
One result was that Jefferson County , containing Birmingham 's industrial and economic powerhouse , contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state , but did not receive a proportional amount in services .
In 1954 , the US Supreme Court ruled in `` Brown v. Board of Education '' that public schools had to be desegregated , but Alabama was slow to comply .
Legal segregation ended in the states in 1964 , but Jim Crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court .
This both deprives local residents of the ability to govern themselves and distracts the legislature from statewide issues .
In the 1980s , an omnibus redistricting case , `` Dillard v. Crenshaw County , '' challenged the at-large voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions , including counties and school boards .
Geography .
Alabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with of total area : 3.2 % of the area is water , making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water , also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the U.S. .

There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama 's constitution .
Critics suggest that Alabama 's constitution highly centralizes power in Montgomery and leaves practically no power in local hands .
Most counties do not have home rule .
Any policy changes proposed around the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and , frequently , by state referendum .
One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism .
Alabama 's government is divided into three coequal branches .
The legislative branch is the Alabama Legislature , a bicameral assembly composed of the Alabama House of Representatives , with 105 members , and the Alabama Senate , with 35 members .
It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901 ;
It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses , either .
At that time , Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting , as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts .
Through the legislative delegations , the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments .
The executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws .
It is headed by the Governor of Alabama .
The current governor of the state is Republican Robert Bentley .
The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases .
All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party .
The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections .
Taxes .
Alabama levies a 2 , 4 , or 5 percent personal income tax , depending upon the amount earned and filing status .
Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax , and can do so even if taking the standard deduction .
For example , the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10 % and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1 % , which means that a diner in Mobile would pay an 11 % tax on a meal .
The corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5 % .
The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes .
For example , in 2003 Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $ 670 million .
County and Local governments .
Alabama has 67 counties .
Each county has its own elected legislative branch , usually called the county commission .
It also has limited executive authority in the county .
Instead , most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved , ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning .
Alabama 's constitution has been amended more than 700 times , and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature , applying to only one county or city .
Alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state , meaning that the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol .
Politics .
During Reconstruction following the American Civil War , Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the Third Military District under General John Pope .
The total effects were greater on the African-American community , as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law .
Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the American Civil Rights Movement , when Whites bureaucratically , and at times , violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform .
Members of the nine seats on the Alabama Supreme Court and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office .
This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles .
In 2010 , Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature , giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years .
Alabama 's 67 County Sheriffs are elected in partisan , at-large races , and Democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts .
Education .
Primary and secondary education .
Together , 1,496 individual schools provide education for 744,637 elementary and secondary students .
That represented an increase of $ 444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year .
While Alabama 's public education system has improved in recent decades , it lags behind in achievement compared to other states .
In the state are four medical schools -LRB- as of fall 2015 -RRB- -LRB- University of Alabama School of Medicine , University of South Alabama and Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine and The Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine - Auburn Campus -RRB- , two veterinary colleges -LRB- Auburn University and Tuskegee University -RRB- , a dental school -LRB- University of Alabama School of Dentistry -RRB- , an optometry college -LRB- University of Alabama at Birmingham -RRB- , two pharmacy schools -LRB- Auburn University and Samford University -RRB- , and five law schools -LRB- University of Alabama School of Law , Birmingham School of Law , Cumberland School of Law , Miles Law School , and the Thomas Goode Jones School of Law -RRB- .
Pomponius Mela tells that Achilles is buried in the island named Achillea , between Boristhene and Ister .
It is said that there , in Leuce island , reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes , and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island ;
The `` Periplus of the Euxine Sea '' gives the following details : `` It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea , for her son Achilles , who dwells there .

Sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice .
To Achilles of Leuce were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters : Achilleion in Messenia -LRB- Stephanus Byzantinus -RRB- , Achilleios in Laconia -LRB- Pausanias , III .25,4 -RRB- Nicolae Densuşianu -LRB- Densuşianu 1913 -RRB- even though he recognized Achilles in the name of Aquileia and in the north arm of the Danube delta , the arm of Chilia -LRB- `` Achileii '' -RRB- , though his conclusion , that Leuce had sovereign rights over Pontos , evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law . ''
Abraham became very close to his stepmother , whom he referred to as `` Mother '' .
His stepmother also acknowledged he did not enjoy `` physical labor '' , but loved to read .
Lincoln was largely self-educated .
His formal schooling from several itinerant teachers was intermittent , the aggregate of which may have amounted to less than a year ;
As he grew into his teens , Lincoln took responsibility for the chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household .
Tall for his age , Lincoln was also strong and athletic .
by 1835 , they were in a relationship but not formally engaged .
She died at the age of 22 on August 25 , 1835 , most likely of typhoid fever .
Late in 1836 , Lincoln agreed to a match with Mary if she returned to New Salem .
On August 16 , 1837 , Lincoln wrote Mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship .
They later met again at a party and married on November 4 , 1842 , in the Springfield mansion of Mary 's married sister .
Edward died on February 1 , 1850 , in Springfield , probably of tuberculosis .
`` Willie '' Lincoln was born on December 21 , 1850 , and died of a fever on February 20 , 1862 .
The deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents .
Abraham Lincoln suffered from `` melancholy '' , a condition which now is referred to as clinical depression .
He was an affectionate , though often absent , husband and father of four children .
Although the economy was booming in the region , the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share .
He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural raconteur in New Salem , though he lacked an education , powerful friends , and money , which may be why he lost .
His second campaign in 1834 was successful .
He won election to the state legislature ;
though he ran as a Whig , many Democrats favored him over a more powerful Whig opponent .
He partnered with Stephen T. Logan from 1841 until 1844 .
Then Lincoln began his practice with William Herndon , whom Lincoln thought `` a studious young man '' .
He supported the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal , which he remained involved with later as a Canal Commissioner .
U.S. House of Representatives , 1847 -- 49 .
From the early 1830s , Lincoln was a steadfast Whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be , `` an old line Whig , a disciple of Henry Clay '' .
Lincoln also supported the Wilmot Proviso , which , if it had been adopted , would have banned slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico .
Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it , the national papers ignored it , and it resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district .
Prairie lawyer .
Lincoln returned to practicing law in Springfield , handling `` every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer '' .
Lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation 's western expansion , particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges .
Republican politics 1854 -- 60 .
Slavery and a `` House Divided '' .
By the 1850s , slavery was still legal in the southern United States , but had been generally outlawed in the northern states , including Illinois , whose original 1818 Constitution forbade slavery , as required by the Northwest Ordinance .
Speaking in his Kentucky accent , with a very powerful voice , he said the Kansas Act had a '' `` declared '' indifference , but as I must think , a covert `` real '' zeal for the spread of slavery .
In March 1857 , the Supreme Court issued its decision in `` Dred Scott v. Sandford '' ;
Lincoln denounced the decision , alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the Slave Power .
I believe this government can not endure permanently half slave and half free .
It will become all one thing , or all the other . ''
The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate , and rallied Republicans across the North .
Lincoln -- Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech .
The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically .
Lincoln warned that `` The Slave Power '' was threatening the values of republicanism , and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that all men are created equal , while Douglas emphasized his Freeport Doctrine , that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not , and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists .
Six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation , the Confederate States of America .
That proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that Congress would not interfere with slavery without Southern consent .
A few weeks before the war , Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution .
Lincoln directed his inaugural address to the South , proclaiming once again that he had no intention , or inclination , to abolish slavery in the Southern states :
Lincoln said as the war was ending :
Beginning of the war .
The commander of Fort Sumter , South Carolina , Major Robert Anderson , sent a request for provisions to Washington , and the execution of Lincoln 's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war .
Kentucky tried to be neutral .
The Confederate attack on Fort Sumter rallied Americans north of the Mason-Dixon line to the defense of the American nation .
Lincoln suspended the writ of `` habeas corpus '' in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach Washington .
Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis , and he responded as commander-in-chief , using unprecedented powers .
He expanded his war powers , and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports , disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress , and after suspending `` habeas corpus '' , arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers .
The U.S. Navy illegally intercepted a British merchant ship , the `` Trent '' , on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys ;
He kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort , consulted with governors , and selected generals based on their past success -LRB- as well as their state and party -RRB- .
`` Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together , '' say Thomas and Hyman .
Lincoln learned from his chief of staff General Henry Halleck , a student of the European strategist Jomini , of the critical need to control strategic points , such as the Mississippi River ;
McClellan 's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress , as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington .
Pope complied with Lincoln 's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north , thus protecting the capital from attack .
Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the Battle of Hampton Roads .
Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan 's failure to reinforce Pope , Lincoln was desperate , and restored him to command of all forces around Washington , to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward .
Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier , Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation .
and , after the 1862 midterm elections , he replaced McClellan with Republican Ambrose Burnside .
Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield , but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined .
Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg .
The mid-term elections in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war , as well as rising inflation , new high taxes , rumors of corruption , the suspension of `` habeas corpus , '' the military draft law , and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market .
they supported the president 's Proclamation , but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army .
The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19 , 1863 .
He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all .
The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort .
Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective : a new birth of freedom in the nation .
General Grant .
Meade 's failure to capture Lee 's army as it retreated from Gettysburg , and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac , persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed .
He fights . ''
With Grant in command , Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters , and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops .
The Confederacy lacked reinforcements , so Lee 's army shrank with every costly battle .
Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grant 's headquarters at City Point , Virginia .
Lincoln and the Republican Party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North , and replaced the Union losses .
Grant 's move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South .
This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and Philip Sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in Virginia 's Shenandoah Valley .
The damage caused by Sherman 's March to the Sea through Georgia in 1864 was limited to a swath , but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal , but rather defeat of the Confederate armies .
When Grant 's 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and Union casualties mounted , the lack of military success wore heavily on the President 's re-election prospects , and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated .
In keeping with that sentiment , Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy , and was opposed by the Radical Republicans , under Rep. Thaddeus Stevens , Sen. Charles Sumner and Sen. Benjamin Wade , political allies of the president on other issues .
Lincoln declared that such an amendment would `` clinch the whole matter '' .
Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican/Unionist platform in the election of 1864 .
Upon ratification , it became the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 6 , 1865 .
As the war drew to a close , Lincoln 's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux ;
Shortly before his assassination , Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction .
Eric Foner argues that :
Redefining the republic and republicanism .
The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country .
In recent years , historians such as Harry Jaffa , Herman Belz , John Diggins , Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincoln 's redefinition of `` republican values '' .
In March 1861 , in Lincoln 's first inaugural address , he explored the nature of democracy .
Other enactments .
Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency , which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them .
He signed the Homestead Act in 1862 , making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost .
Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government : tariffs -LRB- a policy with long precedent -RRB- , and a new Federal income tax .
This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $ 800 -LRB- $ in current dollar terms -RRB- , which was later changed by the Revenue Act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure .
he ordered the military to seize the two papers .
The seizure lasted for two days .
Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States .
The last such proclamation had been during James Madison 's presidency 50 years before .
In 1863 , Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving .
Judicial appointments .
Supreme Court appointments .
Lincoln 's declared philosophy on court nominations was that `` we can not ask a man what he will do , and if we should , and he should answer us , we should despise him for it .
Finally , Lincoln 's Treasury Secretary , Salmon P. Chase , was nominated as Chief Justice , and appointed the same day , on December 6 , 1864 .
Lincoln appointed no judges to the United States circuit courts during his time in office .
As a condition for its admission , West Virginia 's constitution was required to provide for the gradual abolition of slavery .
Assassination and funeral .
John Wilkes Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland ;
though he never joined the Confederate army , he had contacts with the Confederate secret service .
After attending an April 11 , 1865 , speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks , an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president .
Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth , but Booth stabbed him and escaped .
After refusing to surrender to Union troops , Booth was killed by Sergeant Boston Corbett on April 26 .
The dying President was taken across the street to Petersen House .
After remaining in a coma for nine hours , Lincoln died at 7:22 am on April 15 .
Lincoln 's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers , while the city 's church bells rang .
Poet Walt Whitman composed `` When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom 'd '' to eulogize Lincoln , one of four poems he wrote about the assassinated president .
07: assassinate-27 VBD -> JJ
He never joined a church , although he frequently attended with his wife .
However , he was deeply familiar with the Bible , and he both quoted and praised it .
In the 1850s , Lincoln believed in `` providence '' in a general way , and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals ;
He wrote at this time that God `` could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest .
One such claim is that he suffered from a rare genetic disorder MEN2b , which manifests with a medullary thyroid carcinoma , mucosal neuromas and a Marfinoid appearance .
Lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty .
Republicans linked Lincoln 's name to their party .
Many , though not all , in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability .
In the New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president , but as the advocate of the common man who doubtless would have supported the welfare state .
William C. Harris found that Lincoln 's `` reverence for the Founding Fathers , the Constitution , the laws under it , and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism '' .
By the late 1960s , liberals , such as historian Lerone Bennett , were having second thoughts , especially regarding Lincoln 's views on racial issues .
Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968 .
He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs , told jokes that ridiculed blacks , insisted he opposed social equality , and proposed sending freed slaves to another country .
and that he was a `` moral visionary '' who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause , as fast as politically possible .
On the other hand , Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability , defined by the poet John Keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were `` content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts , and not compelled toward fact or reason '' .
The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of Platonism , but , following Plato 's death , Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to empiricism .
His father Nicomachus was the personal physician to King Amyntas of Macedon .
Although there is little information on Aristotle 's childhood , he probably spent some time within the Macedonian palace , making his first connections with the Macedonian monarchy .
There , he traveled with Theophrastus to the island of Lesbos , where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island .
Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest and his attitude towards Persia was unabashedly ethnocentric .
In one famous example , he counsels Alexander to be `` a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians , to look after the former as after friends and relatives , and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants '' .
However , Plato reports that syntax was devised before him , by Prodicus of Ceos , who was concerned by the correct use of words .
Plato believed that deduction would simply follow from premises , hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the conclusion would logically follow .
The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century CE :
It goes from the basics , the analysis of simple terms in the `` Categories , '' the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in `` On Interpretation '' , to the study of more complex forms , namely , syllogisms -LRB- in the `` Analytics '' -RRB- and dialectics -LRB- in the `` Topics '' and `` Sophistical Refutations '' -RRB- .
and the migrations of people after great catastrophes , and their removal to other regions , cause the event to be forgotten .
The places where they rise were once dry , and there is a limit to their operations , but there is none to time .
Physics .
Five elements .
Aristotle proposed a fifth element , aether , in addition to the four proposed earlier by Empedocles .
Each of the four earthly elements has its natural place .
All that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe , i.e. , the center of the Earth .
Water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center .
Air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere .
Fire tends toward the lunar sphere -LRB- in which the Moon orbits -RRB- .
When elements are moved out of their natural place , they naturally move back towards it .
This is `` natural motion '' -- motion requiring no extrinsic cause .
So , for example , in water , earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up ;
Motion .
Aristotle defined motion as the actuality of a potentiality `` as such '' .
Aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally ;
that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential , as a transition toward a potentially possible state .
Causality , the four causes .
Aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active causal factors :
Additionally , things can be causes of one another , causing each other reciprocally , as hard work causes fitness and vice versa , although not in the same way or function , the one is as the beginning of change , the other as the goal .
It must be unusual that something happens by chance .
In other words , if something happens all or most of the time , we can not say that it is by chance .
There is also more specific kind of chance , which Aristotle names `` luck '' , that can only apply to human beings , because it is in the sphere of moral actions .
He refers to metaphysics as `` first philosophy '' , as well as `` the theologic science . ''
Substance , potentiality and actuality .
Aristotle examines the concepts of substance and essence -LRB- `` ousia '' -RRB- in his `` Metaphysics '' -LRB- Book VII -RRB- , and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form .
With regard to the change -LRB- `` kinesis '' -RRB- and its causes now , as he defines in his Physics and On Generation and Corruption 319b -- 320a , he distinguishes the coming to be from :
07: come-34 VBG -> NN
For example , the eyes possess the potentiality of sight -LRB- innate -- being acted upon -RRB- , while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning -LRB- exercise -- acting -RRB- .
`` For that for the sake of which a thing is , is its principle , and the becoming is for the sake of the end ;
07: become-19 VBG -> NN
With this definition of the particular substance -LRB- i.e. , matter and form -RRB- , Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings , for example , `` what is it that makes a man one '' ?
Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things .
Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point , arguing that all universals are instantiated .
Consequently , according to Aristotle , if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time , then it does not exist .
Aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of Lesbos , and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas .
The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen .
His description of the hectocotyl arm , used in sexual reproduction , was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century .
He gave accurate descriptions of ruminants ' four-chambered fore-stomachs , and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark `` Mustelus mustelus '' .
Animals with blood were divided into live-bearing -LRB- mammals -RRB- , and egg-bearing -LRB- birds and fish -RRB- .
For Charles Singer , `` Nothing is more remarkable than -LSB- Aristotle 's -RSB- efforts to -LSB- exhibit -RSB- the relationships of living things as a `` scala naturae '' '' Aristotle 's `` History of Animals '' classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical `` Ladder of Life '' -LRB- `` scala naturae '' or Great Chain of Being -RRB- , placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move .
Also , all of the senses are not inactive during sleep , only the ones that are weary .
When they look away from that stimulus , the next thing they look at appears to be moving in a wave like motion .
When a person is asleep , their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking like a person who is influenced by strong feelings .
He claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it .
The actual sensory experience is perceived by the senses , the fact that it occurred while the person was asleep does not make it part of the dream .
Practical philosophy .
He wrote several treatises on ethics , including most notably , the `` Nicomachean Ethics '' .
Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans , and that this function must be an activity of the `` psuchē '' -LRB- normally translated as `` soul '' -RRB- in accordance with reason -LRB- `` logos '' -RRB- .
Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine , and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others .
