As an anti-dogmatic philosophy , anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy .
Anarchism is usually considered a radical left-wing ideology , and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism , collectivism , syndicalism , mutualism , or participatory economics .
Since the 1890s , and beginning in France , the term `` libertarianism '' has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States ;
Diogenes of Sinope and the Cynics , their contemporary Zeno of Citium , the founder of Stoicism , also introduced similar topics .
Later , some Muslim scholars , such as Amer al-Basri and Abu Hanifa , led movements of boycotting the rulers , paving the way to the waqf -LRB- endowments -RRB- tradition , which served as an alternative to and asylum from the centralized authorities of the emirs .
In each case , government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment .
In `` What is Property ? ''
Proudhon answers with the famous accusation `` Property is theft . ''
He contrasted this with what he called `` possession , '' or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use .
The anarcho-communist Joseph Déjacque was the first person to describe himself as `` libertarian '' .
In 1844 in Germany the post-hegelian philosopher Max Stirner published the book , `` The Ego and Its Own , '' which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism .

According to the `` Encyclopedia Britannica '' `` During the Spanish revolution of 1873 , Pi y Margall attempted to establish a decentralized , or `` cantonalist , '' political system on Proudhonian lines . ''
At first , the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction .
Subsequently , the International became polarised into two camps , with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads .
Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports that `` The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune , and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London .
Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune .
They included George Woodcock states :
Organised labour .
The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists , seeking to `` replace the privilege and authority of the State '' with the `` free and spontaneous organisation of labour . ''

The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair .
Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event , by the following year the celebration of International Workers ' Day on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker 's holiday .
The Spanish Workers Federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement ;
anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain .
The most successful was the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo -LRB- National Confederation of Labour : CNT -RRB- , founded in 1910 .
The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association , a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922 , with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America .
From 1905 onwards , the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal ` expropriations ' . ''
Illegalism as a practice emerged and within it `` The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins -LRB- `` propaganda by the deed '' -RRB- and the anarchist burglars -LRB- `` individual reappropriation '' -RRB- expressed their desperation and their personal , violent rejection of an intolerable society .
However , following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition , the conflict culminated in the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion , which the new government repressed .
07: conflict-20 VBP -> NN
In the Mexican Revolution the Mexican Liberal Party was established and during the early 1910s it led a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in Baja California with the leadership of anarcho-communist Ricardo Flores Magón .
In the 1920s this form found as its main proponents Volin and Sebastien Faure .
It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations .
Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists .
The veteran Italian anarchist , Luigi Fabbri , was one of the first critical theorists of fascism , describing it as `` the preventive counter-revolution . ''
In Germany the anarchist Erich Mühsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 February 1933 , within a few hours after the Reichstag fire in Berlin .
04: unknown-11 JJ -> NN
But even before the fascist victory in 1939 , the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists , who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the Soviet Union .
Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident Marxists and anarchists .
The prominent Italian anarchist Camillo Berneri , who volunteered to fight against Franco was killed instead in Spain by gunmen associated with the Spanish Communist Party .
From 1944 to 1947 , the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement , but was repressed by the new Communist regime .
An International Anarchist Congress with delegates from across Europe was held in Paris in May 1948 .
By February 1946 , the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large-scale operation .
07: send-6 VBG -> NN
In 1956 the Uruguayan Anarchist Federation was founded .
In 1955 the Anarcho-Communist Federation of Argentina renamed itself as the Argentine Libertarian Federation .
The Syndicalist Workers ' Federation was a syndicalist group in active in post-war Britain , and one of Solidarity Federation 's earliest predecessors .
The resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in Robert Graham 's , `` Volume Two : The Emergence of the New Anarchism -LRB- 1939 -- 1977 -RRB- '' .
The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of Barcelona , Spain .
In Denmark , squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the Freetown Christiania , an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen .
Anarchist anthropologist David Graeber and anarchist historian Andrej Grubacic have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism , with those `` who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits '' of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are `` much more informed , among other elements , by indigenous , feminist , ecological and cultural-critical ideas '' , and who by the turn of the 21st century formed `` by far the majority '' of anarchists .
Collectivist anarchism .
Collectivist anarchism , also referred to as `` revolutionary socialism '' or a form of such , is a revolutionary form of anarchism , commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin and Johann Most .
Anarchist , communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive ;
although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour , some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need .
Some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism , believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the realization of individual freedom .
To date , the best known examples of an anarchist communist society -LRB- i.e. , established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon -RRB- , are the anarchist territories during the Spanish Revolution and the Free Territory during the Russian Revolution .
Anarcho-syndicalism .
Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement .
The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are : Workers ' solidarity , Direct action and Workers ' self-management
Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action -- that is , action concentrated on directly attaining a goal , as opposed to indirect action , such as electing a representative to a government position -- will allow workers to liberate themselves .
Anarcha-feminism -LRB- also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism -RRB- combines anarchism with feminism .
Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle , and the anarchist struggle against the state .
L. Susan Brown claims that `` as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power , it is inherently feminist '' .
It developed `` mostly in the Netherlands , Britain , and the United States , before and during the Second World War '' .
The `` Platform '' attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement 's failures during the Russian Revolution .
Synthesis anarchism is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives .
In the 1920s , this form found as its main proponents the anarcho-communists Voline and Sébastien Faure .
Some post-leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting a critique of organisations and morality .
It is critical of formal organisations such as labour unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses .
Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack , permanent class conflict , and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies .
Left-wing market anarchism strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets , while maintaining that , taken to their logical conclusions , these ideas support strongly anti-corporatist , anti-hierarchical , pro-labor positions and anti-capitalism in economics and anti-imperialism in foreign policy .
About the scope of an anarchist society , some anarchists advocate a global one , while others do so by local ones .
The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions , which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory .
Free love .
An important current within anarchism is free love .
Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to Josiah Warren and to experimental communities , viewed sexual freedom as a clear , direct expression of an individual 's sovereignty .
`` Free Society '' -LRB- 1895 -- 1897 as `` The Firebrand '' ;
1897 -- 1904 as `` Free Society '' -RRB- was a major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries .
06: 19th-24 JJ -> NN
Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by Emma Goldman , among others .
Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman `` has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights , and especially for those deprived of their rights .
In fact , before Goldman , heterosexual anarchist Robert Reitzel -LRB- 1849 -- 1898 -RRB- spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based German language journal `` Der arme Teufel '' -LRB- English : The Poor Devil -RRB- .
Early American anarchist Josiah Warren advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established .
In it Stirner names his educational principle `` personalist , '' explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation .
The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of `` Freethought '' and , for a time , `` The Truth Seeker '' .
The schools ' stated goal was to `` educate the working class in a rational , secular and non-coercive setting '' .
Murray Bookchin wrote : `` This period -LSB- 1890s -RSB- was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence .
The first of these was started in New York City in 1911 .
It also inspired the Italian newspaper `` Università popolare '' , founded in 1901 .
Russian christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate .
Tolstoy 's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police .
For him `` without compulsion , education was transformed into culture '' .
A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of unschooling and the free school in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches .
Experiments in Germany led to A. S. Neill founding what became Summerhill School in 1921 .
In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles , anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se .
Criticisms .
Criticisms of anarchism include moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms .
Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or utopian by its critics .
He also argued that `` ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears '' is an `` absurdity . ''
Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child 's life .
These signs often develop gradually , though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress .
Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes ;
Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize ;
Although there is no known cure , there have been reported cases of children who recovered .
An autistic culture has developed , with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder .
The number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s , partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and government-subsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses ;
Social development .
Social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders -LRB- ASD ;
Noted autistic Temple Grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals , or people with normal neural development , as leaving her feeling `` like an anthropologist on Mars '' .
Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism .
For them , the quality of friendships , not the number of friends , predicts how lonely they feel .
Functional friendships , such as those resulting in invitations to parties , may affect the quality of life more deeply .
The limited data suggest that , in children with intellectual disability , autism is associated with aggression , destruction of property , and tantrums .
Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech , and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD : for example , they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object , and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience .
Numerous candidate genes have been located , with only small effects attributable to any particular gene .
Hence , a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited : that is , the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome .
Mechanism .
Autism 's symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain .
The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies .
Pathophysiology .
Unlike many other brain disorders , such as Parkinson 's , autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular , cellular , or systems level ;
06: molecular-23 JJ -> NN
Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autism 's mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception .
Just after birth , the brains of children with autism tend to grow faster than usual , followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood .
Interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life , and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response .
The relationship of neurochemicals to autism is not well understood ;
The role of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors -LRB- mGluR -RRB- in the pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome , the most common identified genetic cause of autism , has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway .
From studies based on event-related potentials , transient changes to the brain 's electrical activity in response to stimuli , there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention , orientation to auditory and visual stimuli , novelty detection , language and face processing , and information storage ;
Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity , stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language , and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects .
A pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child .
If warranted , diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists , observing and assessing cognitive , communication , family , and other factors using standardized tools , and taking into account any associated medical conditions .
Conversely , the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis .
Classification .
Autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders -LRB- PDD -RRB- , which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication , and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior .
The manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum , ranging from individuals with severe impairments -- who may be silent , developmentally disabled , and locked into hand flapping and rocking -- to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches , narrowly focused interests , and verbose , pedantic communication .
No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child 's needs .
Although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence , suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment , the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor , their clinical results are mostly tentative , and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options .
A person with ASD may respond atypically to medications , the medications can have adverse effects , and no known medication relieves autism 's core symptoms of social and communication impairments .
06: social-28 JJ -> NN
Through this movement , people hope to cause others to think of autism as a difference instead of a disease .
These organizations include Autism Speaks , Autism National Committee , Autism Society of America , and many others .
Media has had an influence on how the public perceives those with autism .
Rain Man , a film that won 4 Oscars , depicts a character with autism who has incredible talents and abilities .
Prognosis .
There is no known cure .
Children recover occasionally , so that they lose their diagnosis of ASD ;
It is not known how often recovery happens ;
Most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger , though a few have developed communication skills in later years .
05: younger-11 JJR -> NN
because of inadequate data , these numbers may underestimate ASD 's true rate .
Rates of PDD-NOS 's has been estimated at 3.7 per 1,000 , Asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per 1,000 , and childhood disintegrative disorder at 0.02 per 1,000 .
Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil , and suggested that he be suffocated , although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report .
Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as Asperger syndrome , though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981 .
Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner 's first paper on the subject , notably `` autistic aloneness '' and `` insistence on sameness '' , are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders .
Sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed : some in the community seek a cure , while others believe that autism is simply another way of being .
Albedo
Albedo , or `` reflection coefficient '' , derived from Latin `` albedo '' `` whiteness '' -LRB- or reflected sunlight -RRB- in turn from `` albus '' `` white '' , is the diffuse reflectivity or reflecting power of a surface .
Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4 .
This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds .
As the total amount of reflected radiation can not be directly measured by satellite , a mathematical model of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional-hemispherical reflectance and bi-hemispherical reflectance -LRB- e.g. -RRB- .
Many small objects in the outer Solar System and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about 0.05 .
Although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains , they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless Solar System bodies .
formula_6 ,
where formula_7 is the astronomical albedo , formula_8 is the diameter in kilometers , and formula_9 is the absolute magnitude .
The maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere , varying between three and twelve degrees north .
The minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres , beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination .
Tropical and sub-tropical rain forest areas have low albedo , and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts , which have lower insolation .
Climate and weather .
Albedo affects climate and drives weather .
All weather is a result of the uneven heating of Earth caused by different areas of the planet having different albedos .
Land and ocean regions produce the four basic different types of air masses , depending on latitude and therefore insolation : Warm and dry , which form over tropical and sub-tropical land masses ;
In principle , if no outside temperature change affects this area -LRB- e.g. a warm air mass -RRB- , the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall , deepening the snow -- temperature feedback .
Small-scale effects .
Albedo works on a smaller scale , too .
In sunlight , dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better , thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing .
Trees .
Because forests generally have a low albedo , -LRB- the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis -RRB- , some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation -LRB- or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation -RRB- .
Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer , water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light .
`` On any given day , about half of Earth is covered by clouds , which reflect more sunlight than land and water .
Aerosol effects .
Aerosols -LRB- very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere -RRB- have both direct and indirect effects on Earth 's radiative balance .
As per the effects are :
Black carbon .
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles .
The size of this effect is difficult to quantify : the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m − 2 , with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m − 2 .
Typographic variants .
During Roman times , there were many variations on the letter `` A '' .
First was the monumental or lapidary style , which was used when inscribing on stone or other `` permanent '' mediums .
05: other-17 JJ -> NN
This perishable style was called cursive and numerous variations have survived , such as majuscule cursive , minuscule cursive , and semicursive minuscule .
By the 9th century , the Caroline script , which was very similar to the present-day form , was the principal form used in book-making , before the advent of the printing press .
This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter tau in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers .

Use in writing systems .
English .
In modern English orthography , the letter represents seven different vowel sounds :
The double sequence does not occur in native English words , but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as `` Aaron '' and `` aardvark '' .
Other languages .
In most languages that use the Latin alphabet , denotes an open unrounded vowel , such as , , or .
An exception is Saanich , in which -LRB- and the glyph Á -RRB- stands for a close-mid front unrounded vowel .
A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle , the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.
Finally , the letter A is used to denote size , as in a narrow size shoe , or a small cup size in a brassiere .

As early as 1702 , the French called the tribe the `` Alibamon , '' with French maps identifying the river as `` Rivière des Alibamons '' .
Scholars believe the word comes from the Choctaw `` alba '' -LRB- meaning `` plants '' or `` weeds '' -RRB- and `` amo '' -LRB- meaning `` to cut '' , `` to trim '' , or `` to gather '' -RRB- .

At the same time , many rural people , both White and African American , migrated to the city of Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs .
This did not change until the late 1960s following a lawsuit and court order .
Black citizens in Mobile successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment .
The legislature also changed the boundaries of Tuskegee to a 28-sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits .
The Supreme Court unanimously held that this racial `` gerrymandering '' violated the Constitution .

Achilles
In Greek mythology , Achilles -LRB- ;
Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the `` Iliad '' , other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by Paris , who shot him in the heel with an arrow .
The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership .
R. S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin of the name .
The name Achilleus was a common and attested name among the Greeks soon after the 7th century BC .
Birth .
Achilles was the son of the Nereid Thetis and Peleus , the king of the Myrmidons .
There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events : in `` Argonautica '' -LRB- iv .760 -RRB- Zeus ' sister and wife Hera alludes to Thetis ' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus , that Thetis was so loyal to Hera 's marriage bond that she coolly rejected him .
Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers ' embrace .
In this version of the myth , Achilles ' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege .
Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents .
Had Troilus lived to adulthood , the First Vatican Mythographer claimed , Troy would have been invincible .
Achilles in the `` Iliad '' .
Homer 's `` Iliad '' is the most famous narrative of Achilles ' deeds in the Trojan War .
Achilles ' wrath is the central theme of the poem .
The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the war , and does not narrate Achilles ' death .
It begins with Achilles ' withdrawal from battle after he is dishonored by Agamemnon , the commander of the Achaean forces .
Agamemnon had taken a woman named Chryseis as his slave .
Her father Chryses , a priest of Apollo , begs Agamemnon to return her to him .
Agamemnon refuses and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks .
07: plague-7 VB -> NN
The prophet Calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him .
Achilles does so and Calchas declares Chryseis must be returned to her father .
Agamemnon consents , but then commands that Achilles ' battle prize Briseis be brought to him to replace Chryseis .
Angry at the dishonor of having his plunder and glory taken away -LRB- and as he says later , because he loved Briseis -RRB- , with the urging of his mother Thetis , Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces .
07: urge-28 VBG -> NN
Finally , Achilles finds his prey .
Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before Athena , in the form of Hector 's favorite and dearest brother , Deiphobus , persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face .
Penthesilea .
Achilles , after his temporary truce with Priam , fought and killed the Amazonian warrior queen Penthesilea , but later grieved over her death .
The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus , except that Memnon -LRB- unlike Hector -RRB- was also the son of a goddess .
But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles , Paris , who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister , hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow , killing him .
In 5th-century BC Athens , the intense bond was often viewed in light of the Greek custom of `` paiderasteia '' .
Worship of Achilles in antiquity .
There was an archaic heroic cult of Achilles on the White Island , `` Leuce '' , in the Black Sea off the modern coasts of Romania and Ukraine , with a temple and an oracle which survived into the Roman period .
this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues , because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honor '' .
This island is not inhabited , and goats graze on it , not many , which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships , sacrifice to Achilles .
Every morning they fly out to sea , wet their wings with water , and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it .
They bring animals in their ships , destined to be sacrificed .
Some of these animals they slaughter , others they set free on the island , in Achilles ' honor .
But in case the oracle denies them permission , because there is an oracle here , they add something to the price offered , and if the oracle refuses again , they add something more , until at last , the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient .
03: offer-23 VBN -> NN
There , Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes ' daughters , perhaps under the name `` Pyrrha '' -LRB- the red-haired girl -RRB- .
Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women 's clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods .
In another version of the story , Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes ' women ;
In book 11 of Homer 's `` Odyssey '' , Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades .
But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son 's exploits in the Trojan war , and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus ' heroic actions , Achilles is filled with satisfaction .
He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at Achilleion while passing Troy .
Achilles fought and killed the Amazon Helene .
In some versions of the myth , Achilles has a relationship with his captive Briseis .
Achilles in Greek tragedy .
The Greek tragedian Aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles , given the title `` Achilleis '' by modern scholars .
Extant fragments of the `` Achilleis '' and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play .
The first part of the `` Achilleis '' trilogy , `` The Myrmidons '' , focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus , who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon ;

In doing so , he preserved the Union , abolished slavery , strengthened the federal government , and modernized the economy .
Largely self-educated , he became a lawyer in Illinois , a Whig Party leader , and a member of the Illinois House of Representatives , where he served from 1834 to 1846 .
Reentering politics in 1854 , he became a leader in building the new Republican Party , which had a statewide majority in Illinois .
In 1860 , Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state .
With very little support in the slaveholding states of the South , he swept the North and was elected president in 1860 .
Subsequently , on April 12 , 1861 , a Confederate attack on Fort Sumter inspired the North to enthusiastically rally behind the Union in a declaration of war .
Politically , Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other , by carefully planned political patronage , and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory .
He also made major decisions on Union war strategy , including a naval blockade that shut down the South 's normal trade , moves to take control of Kentucky and Tennessee , and using gunboats to gain control of the southern river system .
On April 14 , 1865 , five days after the April 9th surrender of Confederate commanding general Robert E. Lee , Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth , a Confederate sympathizer .
Captain Lincoln was killed in an Indian raid in 1786 .
His children , including six-year-old Thomas , the future president 's father , witnessed the attack .
The identity of Lincoln 's maternal grandfather is unclear .
According to William Ensign Lincoln 's book `` The Ancestry of Abraham Lincoln '' , Nancy was the daughter of Joseph Hanks ;
Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks were married on June 12 , 1806 , in Washington County , and moved to Elizabethtown , Kentucky , following their marriage .
Of the 816.5 acres that Thomas held in Kentucky , he lost all but of his land in court disputes over property titles .
The farm is preserved as part of the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial .
In 1860 Lincoln noted that the family 's move to Indiana was `` partly on account of slavery '' ;
He owned farms , several town lots and livestock , paid taxes , sat on juries , appraised estates , served on country slave patrols , and guarded prisoners .
On October 5 , 1818 , Nancy Lincoln died of milk sickness , leaving eleven-year-old Sarah in charge of a household that included her father , nine-year-old Abraham , and Dennis Hanks , Nancy 's nineteen-year-old orphaned cousin .
Abraham became adept at using an axe .
He attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match with the renowned leader of a group of ruffians known as `` the Clary 's Grove boys '' .
Historians disagree on who initiated the move .
After the family relocated to Illinois , Abraham became increasingly distant from his father , in part because of his father 's lack of education , and occasionally lent him money .
Marriage and children .
Lincoln 's first romantic interest was Ann Rutledge , whom he met when he first moved to New Salem ;
In the early 1830s , he met Mary Owens from Kentucky when she was visiting her sister .
however , they both had second thoughts about their relationship .
She never replied and the courtship ended .
They met in Springfield , Illinois , in December 1839 and were engaged the following December .
A wedding set for January 1 , 1841 , was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at Lincoln 's initiative .
Robert Todd Lincoln was born in 1843 and Edward Baker Lincoln -LRB- Eddie -RRB- in 1846 .
Robert was the only child to live to adulthood and have children .
Later in life , Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons , and Robert Lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875 .
07: stress-9 VBZ -> NNS
Of his learning method , Lincoln stated : `` I studied with nobody '' .
Admitted to the bar in 1836 , he moved to Springfield , Illinois , and began to practice law under John T. Stuart , Mary Todd 's cousin .
He first articulated this in 1837 , saying , '' -LSB- The -RSB- Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy , but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils . ''
Lincoln later regretted some of his statements , especially his attack on the presidential war-making powers .
Taylor won and Lincoln hoped to be appointed Commissioner of the General Land Office , but that lucrative patronage job went to an Illinois rival , Justin Butterfield , considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer , but in Lincoln 's view , an `` old fossil '' .
On October 16 , 1854 , in his `` Peoria Speech '' , Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery , which he repeated en route to the presidency .
I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself .
In late 1854 , Lincoln ran as a Whig for the U.S. Senate seat from Illinois .
The Whigs had been irreparably split by the Kansas -- Nebraska Act .
Drawing on remnants of the old Whig party , and on disenchanted Free Soil , Liberty , and Democratic Party members , he was instrumental in forging the shape of the new Republican Party .
After the state Republican party convention nominated him for the U.S. Senate in 1858 , Lincoln delivered his House Divided Speech , drawing on , `` A house divided against itself can not stand .
Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes , the Democrats won more seats , and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate .
Lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the Republicans required opposition to slavery , and rejected any `` groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong '' .
05: wrong-28 JJ -> NN
1860 Presidential nomination and campaign .
On May 9 -- 10 , 1860 , the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur .
Exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father -LRB- clearing the land and splitting fence rails with an ax -RRB- , Lincoln 's supporters adopted the label of `` The Rail Candidate '' .
On the third ballot Pennsylvania put him over the top .
Pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs .
Lincoln 's managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others , while following Lincoln 's strong dictate to `` Make no contracts that bind me '' .
As Douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns , Lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches .
The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of `` free labor '' , whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts .
Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes , Douglas 1,376,957 votes , Breckinridge 849,781 votes , and Bell 588,789 votes .
Douglas won Missouri , and split New Jersey with Lincoln .
Bell won Virginia , Tennessee , and Kentucky , and Breckinridge won the rest of the South .
As Lincoln 's election became evident , secessionists made clear their intent to leave the Union before he took office the next March .
by February 1 , 1861 , Florida , Mississippi , Alabama , Georgia , Louisiana , and Texas followed .
There were attempts at compromise .
The Crittenden Compromise would have extended the Missouri Compromise line of 1820 , dividing the territories into slave and free , contrary to the Republican Party 's free-soil platform .
05: free-20 JJ -> NN
William Tecumseh Sherman talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was `` sadly disappointed '' at his failure to realize that `` the country was sleeping on a volcano '' and that the South was preparing for war .
they did just that . ''
On April 15 , Lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts , protect Washington , and `` preserve the Union '' , which , in his view , still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states .
From the start , it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort , and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle , such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army .
he also knew well the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy 's army , rather than simply capturing territory .
McClellan , a young West Point graduate , railroad executive , and Pennsylvania Democrat , took several months to plan and attempt his Peninsula Campaign , longer than Lincoln wanted .
McClellan , who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops , blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign .
The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the CSS `` Virginia '' , formerly the USS `` Merrimack '' , damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk , Virginia , before being engaged and damaged by the USS `` Monitor '' .
Lincoln brought in Joseph Hooker , despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship .
The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest , but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest .
Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May , but continued to command his troops for some weeks .
He ignored Lincoln 's order to divide his troops , and possibly force Lee to do the same in Harper 's Ferry , and tendered his resignation , which Lincoln accepted .
At the beginning of the war , he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery .
On June 19 , 1862 , endorsed by Lincoln , Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory .
Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress 's power to free the slaves within the states , he approved the bill in deference to the legislature .
In it , he stated that `` as a fit and necessary military measure , on January 1 , 1863 , all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward , and forever , be free '' .
Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective , as Union armies advanced south , more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed .
Lincoln 's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was : `` I never , in my life , felt more certain that I was doing right , than I do in signing this paper . ''
Defying Lincoln 's prediction that `` the world will little note , nor long remember what we say here '' , the Address became the most quoted speech in American history .
General Ulysses S. Grant 's victories at the Battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign impressed Lincoln and made Grant a strong candidate to head the Union Army .
Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh , Lincoln had said , `` I ca n't spare this man .
Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant 's political intentions , and being assured that he had none , submitted to the Senate Grant 's promotion to commander of the Union Army .
This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman about the hostilities , as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina .
During Early 's raid on Washington , D.C. in 1864 , Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position ;
As Grant continued to wear down Lee 's forces , efforts to discuss peace began .
Confederate Vice President Stephens led a group to meet with Lincoln , Seward , and others at Hampton Roads .
On April 9 , Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox and the war was effectively over .
Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers -- greatly expanded over peacetime -- to hold the factions of his party together , build support for his own policies , and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket .
Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction .
Lincoln biographers James G. Randall and Richard Current , according to David Lincove , argue that :
The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century .
As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860 , `` Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself . ''
The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States ' First Transcontinental Railroad , which was completed in 1869 .
Also in 1861 , Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of 1861 , creating the first U.S. income tax .
The creation of the system of national banks by the National Banking Act provided a strong financial network in the country .
President Lincoln had planned to reform federal Indian policy .
In the wake of Grant 's casualties in his campaign against Lee , Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft , but it was never issued .
Lincoln 's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior ;
Before Lincoln 's presidency , Thanksgiving , while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century , had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates .
Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known . ''
Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court .
Noah Haynes Swayne , nominated January 21 , 1862 and appointed January 24 , 1862 , was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union .
Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist , would support Reconstruction legislation , and that his appointment united the Republican Party .
Other judicial appointments .
Lincoln appointed 32 federal judges , including four Associate Justices and one Chief Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States , and 27 judges to the United States district courts .
Without his main bodyguard , Ward Hill Lamon , Lincoln left to attend the play `` Our American Cousin '' on April 14 .
Lincoln 's bodyguard , John Parker , left Ford 's Theater during intermission to drink at the saloon next door .
Doctor Charles Leale , an Army surgeon , found the President unresponsive , barely breathing and with no detectable pulse .
Secretary of War Stanton saluted and said , `` Now he belongs to the ages . ''
The late President lay in state in the East Room , and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21 .
Historians have emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow , but also noted that some Lincoln haters cheered when they heard the news .
Religious and philosophical beliefs .
As a young man , Lincoln was a religious skeptic , or , in the words of a biographer , an iconoclast .
Later in life , Lincoln 's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences , who were mostly evangelical Protestants .
These are often based on photographs appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting .
Historical reputation .
In surveys of U.S. scholars ranking presidents conducted since the 1940s , Lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three , often as number one .
Generally , the top three presidents are rated as 1 .
President Lincoln 's assassination increased his status to the point of making him a national martyr .
The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the Mall in Washington .
In the Cold War years , Lincoln 's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes .
By the 1970s Lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives for his intense nationalism , support for business , his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage , his acting in terms of Lockean and Burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition , and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers .
Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln 's image suffered `` erosion , fading prestige , benign ridicule '' in the late 20th century .
Indeed , President Obama , has insisted on using Lincoln 's Bible for his swearing in of office at both his inaugurations .
The most famous and most visited memorials are the Lincoln Memorial in Washington , D.C. ;
There was also the Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln exhibit in Disneyland , and the Hall of Presidents at Walt Disney World , which had to do with Walt Disney admiring Lincoln ever since he was a little boy .
Americans asked , `` What would Lincoln do ? ''
However , Schwartz also finds that since World War II , Lincoln 's symbolic power has lost relevance , and this `` fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness '' .
Shortly after Plato died , Aristotle left Athens and , at the request of Philip of Macedon , tutored Alexander the Great starting from 343 BC .
Aristotle 's views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works .
Their influence extended into the Renaissance and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics .
In metaphysics , Aristotelianism profoundly influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophical and theological thought during the Middle Ages and continues to influence Christian theology , especially the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church .
At about the age of eighteen , Aristotle moved to Athens to continue his education at Plato 's Academy .
He remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving Athens in 348/47 BC .
Aristotle then accompanied Xenocrates to the court of his friend Hermias of Atarneus in Asia Minor .
She bore him a daughter , whom they also named Pythias .
Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of Macedon .
During that time he gave lessons not only to Alexander , but also to two other future kings : Ptolemy and Cassander .
By 335 BC , Artistotle had returned to Athens , establishing his own school there known as the Lyceum .
According to the Suda , he also had an eromenos , Palaephatus of Abydus .
This period in Athens , between 335 and 323 BC , is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works .
Aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time , but made significant contributions to most of them .
04: possible-8 JJ -> NN
In philosophy , he wrote on aesthetics , ethics , government , metaphysics , politics , economics , psychology , rhetoric and theology .
Following Alexander 's death , anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens was rekindled .
In 322 BC , Eurymedon the Hierophant denounced Aristotle for not holding the gods in honor , prompting him to flee to his mother 's family estate in Chalcis , explaining : `` I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy `` a reference to Athens 's prior trial and execution of Socrates .
In modern times , the scope of `` philosophy '' has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries , such as ethics and metaphysics , in which logic plays a major role .
For Aristotle , `` all science -LRB- `` dianoia '' -RRB- is either practical , poetical or theoretical '' -LRB- `` Metaphysics '' 1025b25 -RRB- .
In the period between his two stays in Athens , between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum , Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today .
Today 's scientific method assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective , and that discerning the validity of one 's hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which Aristotle used to support his laws .
He points to the growth of the Nilotic delta since the time of Homer , to the shallowing of the Palus Maeotis within sixty years from his own time ... He alludes ... to the upheaving of one of the Eolian islands , previous to a volcanic eruption .
All causes , proper and incidental , can be spoken as potential or as actual , particular or generic .
Essentially , causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect .
Optics .
Aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day .
The second oldest written evidence of a camera obscura -LRB- after Mozi c. 400 BC -RRB- can be found in Aristotle 's documentation of such a device in 350 BC in `` Problemata '' .
According to Aristotle , luck must involve choice -LRB- and thus deliberation -RRB- , and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice .
`` What is not capable of action can not do anything by chance '' .
Metaphysics .
Aristotle defines metaphysics as `` the knowledge of immaterial being , '' or of `` being in the highest degree of abstraction . ''
In book VIII , he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum , or the stuff of which it is composed .
The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter , and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form .
The coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property .
07: come-2 VBG -> NN
In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality -LRB- `` dynamis '' -RRB- and actuality -LRB- `` entelecheia '' -RRB- in association with the matter and the form .
Referring to potentiality , this is what a thing is capable of doing , or being acted upon , if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else .
Potentially beings can either ` act ' -LRB- `` poiein '' -RRB- or ` be acted upon ' -LRB- `` paschein '' -RRB- , which can be either innate or learned .
Referring then to our previous example , we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do .
and the actuality is the end , and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired .
In summary , the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities , which is also a final cause or end .
In this distinction , there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple .
For example , it is possible that there is no particular good in existence , but `` good '' is still a proper universal form .
According to Aristotle , if a universal exists , either as a particular or a relation , then there must have been , must be currently , or must be in the future , something on which the universal can be predicated .
Another good example of his methods comes from the `` Generation of Animals '' in which Aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to observe when visible organs were generated .
His classification of living things contains some elements which still existed in the 19th century .
Invertebrates -LRB- ` animals without blood ' -RRB- are insects , crustacea -LRB- divided into non-shelled -- cephalopods -- and shelled -RRB- and testacea -LRB- molluscs -RRB- .
Noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth , he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter , with Nature trying to preserve a type of balance .
In a similar fashion , Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man , the `` scala naturae '' .
His system had eleven grades , arranged according `` to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality '' , expressed in their form at birth .
Aristotle also held that the level of a creature 's perfection was reflected in its form , but not preordained by that form .
He placed emphasis on the type -LRB- s -RRB- of soul an organism possessed , asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul , responsible for reproduction and growth , animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul , responsible for mobility and sensation , and humans a vegetative , a sensitive , and a rational soul , capable of thought and reflection .
05: sensitive-50 JJ -> NN
Recollection is the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory `` imprint '' after some time has passed .
When an `` imprint '' is recalled , it may bring forth a large group of related `` imprints '' .
According to Aristotle , association is the power innate in a mental state , which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences , allowing them to rise and be recalled .
Theory of dreams .
Dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus because , as discussed , the senses do not work as they normally do during sleep .
So , dreams result from these lasting impressions .
During sleep , a person is in an altered state of mind .
Aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus .
Since a person sleeping is in this suggestible state , they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams .
This in turn leads the person to believe the dream is real .
So , the dreamer is left to accept the dream because they lack the choice to judge it .
Aristotle reasoned that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are happenstances not divinations .
If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred .
An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see , because the proper function of an eye is sight .
When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom -LRB- `` phronesis '' -RRB- and their intellect -LRB- `` nous '' -RRB- can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue , the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker , or in other words , a philosopher .
Rhetoric and poetics .
