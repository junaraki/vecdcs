Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view , instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy .
-LRB- cf. `` archon '' or , `` arkhē '' , i.e. `` authority '' , `` sovereignty '' , `` realm '' , `` magistracy '' -RRB- -RRB- and the suffix or -LRB- '' - ismos '' , '' - isma '' , from the verbal infinitive suffix - ίζειν , '' - izein '' -RRB- .

Propaganda of the deed and illegalism .
Some anarchists , such as Johann Most , advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because `` we preach not only action in and for itself , but also action as propaganda . ''
Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement , including Tsar Alexander II of Russia , President Sadi Carnot of France , Empress Elisabeth of Austria , King Umberto I of Italy , President William McKinley of the United States , King Carlos I of Portugal and King George I of Greece .
Over the next seventeen months , he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at Sonnenburg , Brandenburg and finally , Oranienburg .
But in 1936 , the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power .
Months later , the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the Spanish Civil War -LRB- 1936 -- 1939 -RRB- .
In response to the army rebellion , an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers , supported by armed militias , took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where they collectivised the land .
Factories were run through worker committees , agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes .
Anarchist historian Sam Dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution , which he claimed `` came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history . ''
Unlike the AFB , which was influenced by anarcho-syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself , the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist , worker-centred strategy from the outset .
In 1968 in Carrara , Italy the International of Anarchist Federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France -LRB- the Fédération Anarchiste -RRB- , the Federazione Anarchica Italiana of Italy and the Iberian Anarchist Federation as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile .
Classical anarchist schools of thought .
Mutualism .
Mutualism began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in France and others in the United States .
06: english-5 JJ -> NN
Proudhon proposed spontaneous order , whereby organisation emerges without central authority , a `` positive anarchy '' where order arises when everybody does `` what he wishes and only what he wishes '' and where `` business transactions alone produce the social order . ''
Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict .
Godwin , a philosophical anarchist , from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present `` necessary evil '' that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge .
Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw unions of egoists , non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties ' support through an act of will , which Stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state .
Later Benjamin Tucker fused Stirner 's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication `` Liberty '' .
From these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals , free love and birth control advocates -LRB- see Anarchism and issues related to love and sex -RRB- , individualist naturists nudists -LRB- see anarcho-naturism -RRB- , freethought and anti-clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation -LRB- see European individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in France -RRB- .

The publication advocated free love and women 's rights , and critiqued `` Comstockery '' -- censorship of sexual information .
Also M. E. Lazarus was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love .
They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality , and the openly bisexual radical Edna St. Vincent Millay and the lesbian anarchist Margaret Anderson were prominent among them .
In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was Emile Armand .
He proposed the concept of `` la camaraderie amoureuse '' to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults .
Mujeres Libres was an anarchist women 's organisation in Spain that aimed to empower working class women .
The organisation was based on the idea of a `` double struggle '' for women 's liberation and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel .
More recently , the British anarcho-pacifist Alex Comfort gained notoriety during the sexual revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual `` The Joy of Sex '' .
Libertarian education and freethought .
For English anarchist William Godwin education was `` the main means by which change would be achieved . ''
Godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness .
In his `` Political Justice '' he criticises state sponsored schooling `` on account of its obvious alliance with national government '' .
In the United States `` freethought was a basically anti-christian , anti-clerical movement , whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters .
Fiercely anti-clerical , Ferrer believed in `` freedom in education '' , education free from the authority of church and state .
Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer 's Modern School -LRB- Escuela Moderna -RRB- , a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally . ''
He thought that `` Education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself ... Education is culture under restraint , culture is free .
Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice .
However , although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian , they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle-approach .
Autism
Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction , verbal and non-verbal communication , and restricted and repetitive behavior .
While autism is highly heritable , researchers suspect both environmental and genetic factors as causes .
In rare cases , autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects .
Early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain self-care , social , and communication skills .
Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood , though some become successful .
As of 2010 , the number of people affected is estimated at about 1 -- 2 per 1,000 worldwide .
The rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the United Kingdom is 1.1 % .
the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved .
Characteristics .
Autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder that first appears during infancy or childhood , and generally follows a steady course without remission .
Autism 's individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly , without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits .
for example , they have less eye contact and turn-taking , and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves , such as pointing at things .
Children with high-functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers , despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone .
Communication .
About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs .
their gestures are less often integrated with words .
Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences , and are more likely to simply repeat others ' words -LRB- echolalia -RRB- or reverse pronouns .
Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language , comprehension and inference .
Repetitive behavior .
Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior , which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised -LRB- RBS-R -RRB- categorizes as follows .
Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis , but that can affect the individual or the family .
Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90 % of those with autism , and are considered core features by some , although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders .
siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults .
However , there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur .
Autism has a strong genetic basis , although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects , or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants .
Several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism .
Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity-dependent changes .
This has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine `` overload '' , a vaccine preservative , or the MMR vaccine for causing autism .
Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible , parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations , outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries , and the preventable deaths of several children .
This is supported by recent studies that have found that infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism .
several have been investigated , with the most evidence for the role of serotonin and of genetic differences in its transport .
Also , some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism , but probably account for less than 5 % of cases .
The MNS may contribute to an individual 's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions , intentions , and emotions .
ASD-related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks .
In autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network , a large-scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing , with intact connectivity of the task-positive network , used in sustained attention and goal-directed thinking .
In the genetic area , relations have been found between autism and schizophrenia based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes ;
Research on autism/schizophrenia relations for chromosome 15 -LRB- 15q13 .3 -RRB- , chromosome 16 -LRB- 16p13 .1 -RRB- and chromosome 17 -LRB- 17p12 -RRB- are inconclusive .
An extension , the extreme male brain theory , hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain , defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing .
However , most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals ' ability to understand other people 's basic intentions or goals ;
The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing : the executive functions such as working memory , planning , inhibition .
A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests ;
two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young children with autism .
Weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism .
These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism .
Neither category is satisfactory on its own ;
social cognition theories poorly address autism 's rigid and repetitive behaviors , while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties .
06: rigid-8 JJ -> NN
The disturbance must not be better accounted for by Rett syndrome , intellectual disability or global developmental delay .
The Childhood Autism Rating Scale -LRB- CARS -RRB- is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children .
A pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills , both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions .
The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression .
Clinical genetics evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed , particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause .
As new genetic tests are developed several ethical , legal , and social issues will emerge .
ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months , although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life : for example , a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later .
Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism , the extent of the overlap between Asperger syndrome , HFA , and non-syndromal autism is unclear .
Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry , psychology , neurology and pediatrics .
Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long-term outcome '' .
US and Japanese practice is to screen all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months , using autism-specific formal screening tests .
It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders .
Prevention .
Infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than 1 % of cases of autism ;
In general , higher IQs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes .
Families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment .
Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy , however the development of evidence-based interventions has advanced in recent years .
There is some evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention -LRB- EIBI -RRB- , an early intervention model based on ABA for 20 to 40 hours a week for multiple years , is an effective treatment for some children with ASD .
Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators , resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided .
It is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up , and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results .
Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function , suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism .
After childhood , key treatment issues include residential care , job training and placement , sexuality , social skills , and estate planning .
Proponents of this movement wish to seek `` acceptance , not cures . ''
There have also been many worldwide events promoting autism awareness such as World Autism Awareness Day , Light It Up Blue , Autism Sunday , Autistic Pride Day , Autreat , and others .
Some adults show modest improvement in communication skills , but a few decline ;
Most , but not all , people with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood .
Globally , autism affects an estimated 21.7 million people as of 2013 , while Asperger syndrome affects a further 31.1 million .
This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices , referral patterns , availability of services , age at diagnosis , and public awareness , though unidentified environmental risk factors can not be ruled out .
Most professionals believe that race , ethnicity , and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism .
Several other conditions are common in children with autism .
They include :
History .
A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named .
The `` Table Talk '' of Martin Luther , compiled by his notetaker , Mathesius , contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic .
The New Latin word `` autismus '' -LRB- English translation `` autism '' -RRB- was coined by the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia .
It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger .
Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong , distinguishing it from intellectual disability and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders , and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy .
It is the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it .
Its dimensionless nature lets it be expressed as a percentage and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflection of a perfectly black surface to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface .
The average overall albedo of Earth , its `` planetary albedo '' , is 30 to 35 % because of cloud cover , but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features .
If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers , the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0 ° C .
These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface .
For example , the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer Solar System objects , the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties , whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids .
Insolation effects .
The intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation ;
Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo , high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes .
Albedo -- temperature feedback .
A layer of snowfall increases local albedo , reflecting away sunlight , leading to local cooling .
When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo , such as grass or soil , the effect is reversed : the darkening surface lowers albedo , increasing local temperatures , which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further , resulting in still more heating .
In seasonally snow-covered zones , winter albedos of treeless areas are 10 % to 50 % higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily .
Studies by the Hadley Centre have investigated the relative -LRB- generally warming -RRB- effect of albedo change and -LRB- cooling -RRB- effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests .
new forests in high latitudes -LRB- e.g. Siberia -RRB- were neutral or perhaps warming .
The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the Fresnel equations -LRB- see graph -RRB- .
The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this .
At small angles of incident light , waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs .
- incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle .
Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light , it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the terminator -LRB- early morning , late afternoon , and near the poles -RRB- .

When the ancient Greeks adopted the alphabet , they had no use for the glottal stop -- the first phoneme of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter , and the sound that the letter denoted in Phoenician and other Semitic languages -- so they used an adaptation of the sign to represent the vowel , and gave it the similar name of alpha .
Following World War II , Alabama experienced growth as the economy of the state changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests .
Alabama is nicknamed the `` Yellowhammer State '' , after the state bird .
The state tree is the longleaf pine , and the state flower is the camellia .
Etymology .
The European-American naming of the Alabama River and state originates from the Alabama people , a Muskogean-speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river .
The state has numerous place names of Native American origin .
History .
Pre-European settlement .
Indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before European colonization .
Trade with the northeastern tribes via the Ohio River began during the Burial Mound Period -LRB- 1000 BC -- AD 700 -RRB- and continued until European contact .
Analysis of artifacts recovered from archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars ' formulating the characteristics of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex -LRB- SECC -RRB- .
it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood .

The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves , collar and coat tails .
Alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in May 1865 until its official restoration to the Union in 1868 .
Besides the short-lived original Ku Klux Klan , these included the Pale Faces , Knights of the White Camellia , Red Shirts , and the White League .
By 1903 , only 2,980 African Americans were registered in Alabama , although at least 74,000 were literate .
Despite numerous legal challenges that succeeded in overturning certain provisions , the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement .
Into the 1950s , the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities : jails were segregated in 1911 ;
In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds , which paid one-third of the construction costs .
Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice , by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools , which were built in many rural areas .
Continued racial discrimination and lynchings , agricultural depression , and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the Great Migration out of the South .

Alabama , along with Oklahoma , has the most reported EF5 tornadoes of any state , according to statistics from the National Climatic Data Center for the period January 1 , 1950 , to June 2013 .
Alabama once boasted huge expanses of pine forest , which still form the largest proportion of forests in the state .
Demographics .
The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Alabama was 4,849,377 on July 1 , 2014 , which represents an increase of 69,641 , or 1.46 % , since the 2010 Census .
The center of population of Alabama is located in Chilton County , outside the town of Jemison .
In 2011 , 46.6 % of Alabama 's population younger than age 1 were minorities .
many Anglo-Americans identify as having American ancestry because their roots have been in North America for so long , in some cases since the 1600s .
Based on historic migration and settlement patterns in the southern colonies and states , demographers estimated there are more people in Alabama of Scots-Irish origins than self-reported .
In 1984 , under the Davis -- Strong Act , the state legislature established the Alabama Indian Affairs Commission .
Native American groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination .
In the past , their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black .
These are :
The state government has promoted recognition of Native American contributions to the state , including the designation in 2000 for Columbus Day to be jointly celebrated as American Indian Heritage Day .
In the major Southern speech region , there is the decreasing loss of the final / r / , for example the / boyd / pronunciation of ` bird . '
Christianity .
Alabama is located in the middle of the Bible Belt , a region of numerous Protestant Christians .
Alabama has been identified as one of the most religious states in the United States , with about 58 % of the population attending church regularly .
The Assemblies of God had almost 60,000 members , the Churches of Christ had nearly 120,000 members .
In a 2007 survey , nearly 70 % of respondents could name all four of the Christian Gospels .
In a 2007 poll , 92 % of Alabamians reported having at least some confidence in churches in the state .
The oldest Jewish congregation in the state is Congregation Sha'arai Shomayim in Mobile .
It was formally recognized by the state legislature on January 25 , 1844 .
Later immigrants in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries tended to be Ashkenazy Jews from eastern Europe .
Jewish denominations in the state include two Orthodox , four Conservative , ten Reform , and one Humanistic synagogue .

Property taxes are the lowest in the U.S. .
Since Alabama 's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending , it is subject to high variable budget structure .
Because of the constraints of the Alabama Constitution , only seven counties -LRB- Jefferson , Lee , Mobile , Madison , Montgomery , Shelby , and Tuscaloosa -RRB- in the state have limited home rule .
A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation , taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance . ''
After 1890 , a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise African American residents , a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution .
Democrat George Wallace , the state 's only four-term governor , was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation .
In many jurisdictions , they continued to be excluded from representation by at-large electoral systems , which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections .
In 2007 , the Alabama Legislature passed , and Republican Governor Bob Riley signed a resolution expressing `` profound regret '' over slavery and its lingering impact .
Elections .
State elections .
With the disfranchisement of African Americans in 1901 , the state became part of the `` Solid South '' , a system in which the Democratic Party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state .
Only two Republican Lieutenant Governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction , when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government , including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise .

Etymology .
Achilles ' name can be analyzed as a combination of -LRB- `` akhos '' -RRB- `` grief '' and -LRB- `` laos '' -RRB- `` a people , tribe , nation . ''
Achilles ' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of κλέος `` kleos '' -LRB- `` glory '' , usually glory in war -RRB- .
Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until Prometheus , the fore-thinker , warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father .
It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier .
In another version of this story , Thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire , to burn away the mortal parts of his body .
He cast two spears at once , one grazed Achilles ' elbow , `` drawing a spurt of blood '' .
Also , in the fragmentary poems of the Epic Cycle in which we can find description of the hero 's death , `` Cypria '' -LRB- unknown author -RRB- , `` Aithiopis '' by Arctinus of Miletus , `` Little Iliad '' by Lesche of Mytilene , `` Iliou persis '' by Arctinus of Miletus , there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness -LRB- heel -RRB- ;
Achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral .
The poem ends with a description of Hector 's funeral , with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come .
At first , he was so distracted by her beauty , he did not fight as intensely as usual .
Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life , he refocused and killed her .
Memnon , and the fall of Achilles .
When Memnon , king of Ethiopia slew Antilochus , Achilles once more obtained revenge on the battlefield , killing Memnon .
The `` Aethiopis '' is now lost , except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors .
In some versions , the god Apollo guided Paris ' arrow .
Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow .
His bones were mingled with those of Patroclus , and funeral games were held .
He was represented in the `` Aethiopis '' as living after his death in the island of Leuke at the mouth of the river Danube .
Achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of Patroclus .
They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners , who after considering both men came to a consensus in favor of Odysseus .
Achilles , Ajax and a game of `` petteia '' .
At some point in the war , Achilles and Ajax were playing a board game -LRB- `` petteia '' -RRB- .
Achilles and Patroclus .
The exact nature of Achilles ' relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times .
In Plato 's `` Symposium '' , the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple ;
In the lost epic '' Aithiopis '' , a continuation of the `` Iliad '' attributed to Arktinus of Miletos , Achilles ' mother Thetis returned to mourn him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to Leuce at the mouths of the Danube .
Achilles from Leuce island was venerated as `` Pontarches '' the lord and master of the Pontic Sea , the protector of sailors and navigation .
Ammianus Marcellinus -LRB- XXII .8 -RRB- attributes the healing to waters -LRB- `` aquae '' -RRB- on the island .
Worship of Achilles in modern times : The Achilleion in Corfu .
In the region of Gastouri -LRB- Γαστούρι -RRB- to the south of the city of Corfu Greece , Empress of Austria Elisabeth of Bavaria also known as Sissi built in 1890 a summer palace with Achilles as its central theme and it is a monument to platonic romanticism .
In AD 216 the Roman Emperor Caracalla , while on his way to war against Parthia , emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles ' tumulus .
only a few lines survive today .
In Plato 's `` Symposium '' , Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved ;
Only a few fragments survive .
Towards the end of the 5th century BC , a more negative view of Achilles emerges in Greek drama ;
As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school , Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions .
Vergil refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men , while Horace portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children .

Abraham Lincoln
Abraham Lincoln -LRB- February 12 , 1809 -- April 15 , 1865 -RRB- was the 16th President of the United States , serving from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865 .
Lincoln led the United States through its Civil War -- its bloodiest war and its greatest moral , constitutional , and political crisis .
Born in Hodgenville , Kentucky , Lincoln grew up on the western frontier in Kentucky and Indiana .
Elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1846 , Lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks , tariffs , and railroads .
Because he had originally agreed not to run for a second term in Congress , and because his opposition to the Mexican -- American War was unpopular among Illinois voters , Lincoln returned to Springfield and resumed his successful law practice .
His victory prompted seven southern slave states to form the Confederate States of America before he moved into the White House - no compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery and secession .
Lincoln initially concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war .
His primary goal was to reunite the nation .
He suspended habeas corpus , leading to the controversial `` ex parte Merryman '' decision , and he averted potential British intervention in the war by defusing the Trent Affair in late 1861 .
An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state , Lincoln reached out to the War Democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the 1864 presidential election .
Anticipating the war 's conclusion , Lincoln pushed a moderate view of Reconstruction , seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness .
Family and childhood .
Early life and family ancestry .
Abraham Lincoln was born February 12 , 1809 , the second child of Thomas and Nancy Hanks Lincoln , in a one-room log cabin on the Sinking Spring Farm in Hardin County , Kentucky -LRB- now LaRue County -RRB- .
-LRB- Their land in southern Indiana became part of Spencer County , Indiana , when the county was established in 1818 . -RRB-
but mainly due to land title difficulties in Kentucky .
During the family 's years in Kentucky and Indiana , Thomas Lincoln worked as a farmer , cabinetmaker , and carpenter .
Thomas and Nancy Lincoln were also members of a Separate Baptists church , which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol , dancing , and slavery .
Several significant family events took place during Lincoln 's youth in Indiana .
On December 2 , 1819 , Lincoln 's father married Sarah `` Sally '' Bush Johnston , a widow from Elizabethtown , Kentucky , with three children of her own .
however , he was an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning .
Family , neighbors , and schoolmates of Lincoln 's youth recalled that he read and reread the `` King James Bible '' , `` Aesop 's Fables '' , Bunyan 's `` The Pilgrim 's Progress '' , Defoe 's `` Robinson Crusoe '' , Weems 's `` The Life of Washington '' , and Franklin 's `` Autobiography '' , among others .
In 1846 , Lincoln was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives , where he served one two-year term .
Lincoln , in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman Joshua R. Giddings , wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with compensation for the owners , enforcement to capture fugitive slaves , and a popular vote on the matter .
The administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the Oregon Territory .
This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold , and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in Illinois , so he declined and resumed his law practice .
In fact , he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge .
The decision by the Illinois Supreme Court has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation .
From 1853 to 1860 , another of Lincoln 's largest clients was the Illinois Central Railroad .
Lincoln 's reputation with clients gave rise to his nickname `` Honest Abe . ''
The case is famous for Lincoln 's use of a fact established by judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness .
Based on this evidence , Armstrong was acquitted .
Lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom ;
but in an 1859 case , where he defended a cousin , Peachy Harrison , who was accused of stabbing another to death , Lincoln angrily protested the judge 's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client .
Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle , opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers , especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence .
Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858 , since he had led the opposition to the Lecompton Constitution , which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state .
The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would , in turn , select Lincoln or Douglas as its U.S. senator .
Despite the bitterness of the defeat for Lincoln , his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation .
On February 27 , 1860 , New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a speech at Cooper Union to a group of powerful Republicans .
Historian Donald described the speech as a `` superb political move for an unannounced candidate , to appear in one rival 's -LRB- William H. Seward -RRB- own state at an event sponsored by the second rival 's -LRB- Salmon P. Chase -RRB- loyalists , while not mentioning either by name during its delivery '' .
On December 20 , 1860 , South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession ;
The upper South and border states -LRB- Delaware , Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina , Tennessee , Kentucky , Missouri , and Arkansas -RRB- listened to , but initially rejected , the secessionist appeal .
En route to his inauguration by train , Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North .
On February 23 , 1861 , he arrived in disguise in Washington , D.C. , which was placed under substantial military guard .
The failure of the Peace Conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible .
By March 1861 , no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms .
On April 12 , 1861 , Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter , forcing them to surrender , and began the war .
Donald concludes that , `` His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood .
Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland , but did not prevail ;
On April 19 , mobs in Baltimore , which controlled the rail links , attacked Union troops who were changing trains , and local leaders ' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital .
Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions .
In addition , Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict .
Conversely , the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery .
In practice , the law had little effect , but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy .
In late August 1861 , General John C. Frémont , the 1856 Republican presidential nominee , issued , without consulting his superiors in Washington , a proclamation of martial law in Missouri .
The Trent Affair of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain .
Lincoln resolved the issue by releasing the two men and war was successfully averted with Britain .
Seward 's initial reaction to the `` Trent '' affair , however , was too bellicose , so Lincoln also turned to Senator Charles Sumner , the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and an expert in British diplomacy .
General McClellan .
After the Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and the retirement of the aged Winfield Scott in late 1861 , Lincoln appointed Major General George B. McClellan general-in-chief of all the Union armies .
However , lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan , now commanding the Army of the Potomac , Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862 , forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time .
While Republicans were discouraged , Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania , Ohio , Indiana , and New York .
In the spring of 1863 , Lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together ;
At the same time , after initial setbacks , Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor .
Emancipation Proclamation .
Lincoln understood that the Federal government 's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution , which before 1865 , committed the issue to individual states .
President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General John C. Frémont in August 1861 and by Major General David Hunter in May 1862 , on the grounds that it was not within their power , and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union .
Enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation .
Frederick Douglass once observed of Lincoln : `` In his company , I was never reminded of my humble origin , or of my unpopular color '' .
He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain , that slavery would end as a result of the losses , and the future of democracy in the world would be assured , that `` government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth '' .
Lincoln was a master politician , bringing together -- and holding together -- all the main factions of the Republican Party , and bringing in War Democrats such as Edwin M. Stanton and Andrew Johnson as well .
On November 8 , Lincoln was re-elected in a landslide , carrying all but three states , and receiving 78 percent of the Union soldiers ' vote .
Lincoln said :
Reconstruction .
Reconstruction began during the war , as Lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states , and how to determine the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves .
On the other hand , the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient , and passed their own plan , the Wade-Davis Bill , in 1864 .
By December 1863 , a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to Congress for passage .
After a long debate in the House , a second attempt passed Congress on January 31 , 1865 , and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification .
Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states , until readmission under the control of southern Unionists .
As early as the 1850s , a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution , Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values -- what he called the `` sheet anchor '' of republicanism .

In June 1864 , Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress , which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as Yosemite National Park .
Samuel Freeman Miller , nominated and appointed on July 16 , 1862 , supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist .
Stephen Johnson Field , a previous California Supreme Court justice , was nominated March 6 , 1863 and appointed March 10 , 1863 , and provided geographic balance , as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat .
The now unguarded President sat in his state box in the balcony .
After being on the run for 12 days , Booth was tracked down and found on a farm in Virginia , some south of Washington .
President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00 am , less than 3 hours after Lincoln 's death .
For his final journey with his son Willie , both caskets were transported in the executive coach `` United States '' and for three weeks the `` Lincoln Special '' funeral train decorated in black bunting bore Lincoln 's remains on a slow circuitous waypoint journey from Washington D.C. to Springfield , Illinois , stopping at many cities across the North for large-scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands , as well as many people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands , bonfires , and hymn singing or silent reverence with hat in hand as the railway procession slowly passed by .
In Aristotle 's terminology , `` natural philosophy '' is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world , and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics , biology and other natural sciences .
-LRB- 2 -RRB- Theoretical Philosophy , including Metaphysics , Physics and Mathematics ;
Aristotle 's metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics .
His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass , velocity , force and temperature .
His writings provide an account of many scientific observations , a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors .
In a similar vein , John Philoponus , and later Galileo , showed by simple experiments that Aristotle 's theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect .
Because he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by European thinkers during and after the Renaissance , these thinkers often took Aristotle 's erroneous positions as given , which held back science in this epoch .
So also of all other rivers ;
they spring up and they perish ;
and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others The same tracts , therefore , of the earth are not some always sea , and others always continents , but every thing changes in the course of time . '
-LRB- Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect -RRB- .
Moreover , Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects ;
its presence and absence may result in different outcomes .
Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event .
Our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino , because it can not fall of its own accord .
Aristotle marked two modes of causation : proper -LRB- prior -RRB- causation and accidental -LRB- chance -RRB- causation .
The same language refers to the effects of causes , so that generic effects assigned to generic causes , particular effects to particular causes , operating causes to actual effects .
Aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was , the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object .
Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things .
For a better understanding of Aristotle 's conception of `` chance '' it might be better to think of `` coincidence '' : Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place , but with the result of another thing -LRB- not intended -RRB- taking place .
For example , the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially -LRB- `` dynamei '' -RRB- plant , and if is not prevented by something , it will become a plant .
Actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality .
Because the end -LRB- `` telos '' -RRB- is the principle of every change , and for the sake of the end exists potentiality , therefore actuality is the end .
For animals do not see in order that they may have sight , but they have sight that they may see . ''
Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula , in time and in substantiality .
Since , according to Plato there are two Ideas : animal and biped , how then is man a unity ?
However , according to Aristotle , the potential being -LRB- matter -RRB- and the actual one -LRB- form -RRB- are one and the same thing .
Universals and particulars .
Aristotle 's predecessor , Plato , argued that all things have a universal form , which could be either a property , or a relation to other things .
When we look at an apple , for example , we see an apple , and we can also analyze a form of an apple .
Moreover , we can place an apple next to a book , so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other .
As Plato spoke of the world of the forms , a location where all universal forms subsist , Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated .
His observations on catfish , electric fish -LRB- `` Torpedo '' -RRB- and angler-fish are detailed , as is his writing on cephalopods , namely , `` Octopus '' , `` Sepia '' -LRB- cuttlefish -RRB- and the paper nautilus -LRB- `` Argonauta argo '' -RRB- .

Ideas like this , and his ideas about souls , are not regarded as science at all in modern times .
Notable is Aristotle 's division of sensation and thought , which generally went against previous philosophers , with the exception of Alcmaeon .
Successor : Theophrastus .
Aristotle 's successor at the Lyceum , Theophrastus , wrote a series of books on botany -- the `` History of Plants '' -- which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany , even into the Middle Ages .
Theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants , though this last discovery was lost in later ages .
The first medical teacher at Alexandria , Herophilus of Chalcedon , corrected Aristotle , placing intelligence in the brain , and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation .
like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally .
The unique part of the human , rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them .
For Aristotle , the soul -LRB- `` psyche '' -RRB- was a simpler concept than it is for us today .
Memory .
According to Aristotle , memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in your mind and to have the ability to distinguish between the internal `` appearance '' and an occurrence in the past .
In other words , a memory is a mental picture -LRB- phantasm -RRB- in which Aristotle defines in `` De Anima '' , as an appearance which is imprinted on the part of the body that forms a memory .
The mental picture imprinted on the bodily organ is the final product of the entire process of sense perception .
Second , the intellectual anxiety that comes with the `` imprint '' due to being impressed at a particular time and processing specific contents .
A transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences , both for our previous experience and present experience .
He believed the young and the old do not properly develop an `` imprint '' .
Likewise , people who are too quick-witted are similar to the young and the image can not be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ .
Recollection .
Because Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or `` imprints '' , people are continually weaving together new `` imprints '' of things they experience .
Aristotle believed the chain of thought , which ends in recollection of certain `` imprints '' , was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships : similarity , contrast , and contiguity .
However , the senses are able to work during sleep , albeit differently than when a person is awake because during sleep a person can still have sensory experiences .
However , during sleep the impressions stimuli made throughout the day become noticed because there are not new sensory experiences to distract from these impressions that were made .
Dreams may be absurd in nature but the senses are not able to discern whether they are real or not .
Aristotle also includes in his theory of dreams what constitutes a dream and what does not .
For example , if , while a person is sleeping , a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut , Aristotle argues that this sensory experience is not part of the dream .
