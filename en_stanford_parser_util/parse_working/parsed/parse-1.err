Anarchism holds the state to be undesirable , unnecessary , or harmful .
Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally , supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism .
Etymology and terminology .
The term `` anarchism '' is a compound word composed from the word `` anarchy '' and the suffix '' - ism '' , themselves derived respectively from the Greek , i.e. `` anarchy '' -LRB- from , `` anarchos '' , meaning `` one without rulers '' ;
This is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful idolatry .
The French renaissance political philosopher Étienne de La Boétie wrote in his most famous work the `` Discourse on Voluntary Servitude '' what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent .
The term `` anarchist '' first entered the English language in 1642 , during the English Civil War , as a term of abuse , used by Royalists against their Roundhead opponents .
By the turn of the 19th century , the English word `` anarchism '' had lost its initial negative connotation .
Modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment , particularly Jean-Jacques Rousseau 's arguments for the moral centrality of freedom .
Godwin was , according to Peter Kropotkin , `` the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism , even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work '' , while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early Edmund Burke .
First International and the Paris Commune .
In Europe , harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848 , during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings .
The Catalan politician Francesc Pi i Margall became the principal translator of Proudhon 's works into Spanish and later briefly became president of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party .
Woodcock also reports that the American individualist anarchists Lysander Spooner and William B. Greene had been members of the First International .
They allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the International , who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property .

Bakunin characterised Marx 's ideas as centralist and predicted that , if a Marxist party came to power , its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against .
Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present , and the General Council 's resolutions passed almost unanimously .
Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers . ''
In 1872 , the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress , where Bakunin and James Guillaume were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York .
The next day , 4 May , anarchists staged a rally at Chicago 's Haymarket Square .
A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally , killing an officer .
In the ensuing panic , police opened fire on the crowd and each other .

The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement .
Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution .
The incident became known as the Haymarket affair , and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day .
Various themes were treated during the Congress , in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement , popular education issues , the general strike or antimilitarism .
He thought that the trade-union movement was reformist and even conservative , citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials .
Before the 1940s , the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics , attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the Spanish Civil War .
the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T. as a revolutionary organization was
undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation .
The largest and most militant of these organizations was the Federación Obrera Regional Argentina ... it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million , which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions . ''
France 's Bonnot Gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism .
Peter Kropotkin thus wrote that year in `` Le Révolté '' that `` a structure based on centuries of history can not be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite '' .
The dismemberment of the French socialist movement , into many groups and , following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune , the execution and exile of many `` communards '' to penal colonies , favoured individualist political expression and acts .
Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia , criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised .
For them , Bakunin 's predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new `` socialist '' Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true .
Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements .
The revolutionary wave of 1917 -- 23 saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism .
In the German uprising known as the German Revolution of 1918 -- 1919 which established the Bavarian Soviet Republic the anarchists Gustav Landauer , Silvio Gesell and Erich Mühsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures .
Platformist groups active today include the Workers Solidarity Movement in Ireland and the North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists of North America .
Conflicts with European fascist regimes .
In the 1920s and 1930s , the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism 's conflict with the state .
Italian anarchists played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation `` Arditi del Popolo '' , which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions , and achieved some success in their activism , such as repelling Blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of Parma in August 1922 .
The Mexican Anarchist Federation was established in 1945 after the Anarchist Federation of the Centre united with the Anarchist Federation of the Federal District .
In 1945 in France the Fédération Anarchiste and the anarchosyndicalist trade union Confédération nationale du travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist Federazione Anarchica Italiana was founded in Italy .
It was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved Anarchist Federation of Britain .
Anarcho-pacifism became influential in the Anti-nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the English anarchist member of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Alex Comfort or the similar activism of the American catholic anarcho-pacifists Ammon Hennacy and Dorothy Day .
According to anarchist scholar Simon Critchley , `` contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary neo-liberalism ... One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility , whether sexual , ecological or socio-economic ;
A component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate , and usually temporary , `` necessary evil '' but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy .
Individualist anarchism .
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups , society , traditions , and ideological systems .
According to Stirner , the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire , without regard for God , state , or morality .
Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals .
`` Egoism '' has inspired many interpretations of Stirner 's philosophy .
For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster `` It is apparent ... that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews ... William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form . '' .
Anarcho-syndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change , replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers .
They should not have bosses or `` business agents '' ;
rather , the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves .
Rudolf Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement .
He outlined a view of the origins of the movement , what it sought , and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet `` Anarcho-Syndicalism '' .
It was also an important force in the Spanish Civil War .
Post-classical schools of thought .
Anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements , at times eclectic , drawing upon various sources , and syncretic , combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches .
It generally views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralised free association .
In essence , the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa .
Anarcha-feminism began with the late 19th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as Emma Goldman and Voltairine de Cleyre .
Christian anarchism is a movement in political theology that combines anarchism and Christianity .
Platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of Dielo Truda 's `` Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists -LRB- Draft -RRB- '' .
Post-left anarchy is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism 's relationship to traditional Left-wing politics .
Insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory , practice , and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasizes insurrection within anarchist practice .
Instead , insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small affinity group based organisation .
Post-anarchism is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought , drawing from diverse ideas including post-modernism , autonomist marxism , post-left anarchy , Situationist International , and postcolonialism .
Internal issues and debates .
Anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes , tendencies and schools of thought ;
as such , disagreement over questions of values , ideology and tactics is common .
The compatibility of capitalism , nationalism , and religion with anarchism is widely disputed .
Similarly , anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as Marxism , communism and capitalism .
Anarchists may be motivated by humanism , divine authority , enlightened self-interest , veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines .
Phenomena such as civilization , technology -LRB- e.g. within anarcho-primitivism and insurrectionary anarchism -RRB- , and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others .
On a tactical level , while propaganda of the deed was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century -LRB- e.g. the Nihilist movement -RRB- , some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as nonviolence , counter-economics and anti-state cryptography to bring about an anarchist society .
In New York City 's Greenwich Village , bohemian feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women -LRB- and also men -RRB- in the here and now .
Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman , indeed the first and only American , to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public . ''
He was also a consistent proponent of polyamory .
In Germany the stirnerists Adolf Brand and John Henry Mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality .
It was founded in 1936 by Lucía Sánchez Saornil , Mercedes Comaposada and Amparo Poch y Gascón and had approximately 30,000 members .
In order to gain mutual support , they created networks of women anarchists .
Lucía Sánchez Saornil was a main founder of the Spanish anarcha-feminist federation Mujeres Libres who was open about her lesbianism .
She was published in a variety of literary journals where working under a male pen name , she was able to explore lesbian themes at a time when homosexuality was criminalized and subject to censorship and punishment .
Max Stirner wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called `` The False Principle of our Education '' .
A number of contributors to `` Liberty '' -LRB- anarchist publication -RRB- were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism .
E.C. Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal `` Lucifer , the Light-Bearer '' '' .
`` Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers ;
reprints from freethought papers such as `` Lucifer , the Light-Bearer '' , `` Freethought '' and `` The Truth Seeker '' appeared in `` Liberty '' ... The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself '' .
Globally , autism is estimated to affect 21.7 million people as of 2013 .
It occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls .
About 1.5 % of children in the United States -LRB- one in 68 -RRB- are diagnosed with ASD , a 30 % increase from one in 88 in 2012 .
It is distinguished not by a single symptom , but by a characteristic triad of symptoms : impairments in social interaction ;
see Classification -RRB- from other developmental disorders .
People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted .
Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms ;
Three - to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding , approach others spontaneously , imitate and respond to emotions , communicate nonverbally , and take turns with others .
There are many anecdotal reports , but few systematic studies , of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD .
Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life , and may include delayed onset of babbling , unusual gestures , diminished responsiveness , and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver .
No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism , but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors .
Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention , relative to the general population .
Differences are greater for under-responsivity -LRB- for example , walking into things -RRB- than for over-responsivity -LRB- for example , distress from loud noises -RRB- or for sensation seeking -LRB- for example , rhythmic movements -RRB- .

Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes , the environment , and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA but are heritable and influence gene expression .
The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from copy number variations -- spontaneous deletions or duplications in genetic material during meiosis .
Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways , such as those involved with cell adhesion .
Exposure to air pollution during pregnancy , especially heavy metals and particulates , may increase the risk of autism .
Environmental factors that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism , or may be important in future research , include certain foods , infectious diseases , solvents , diesel exhaust , PCBs , phthalates and phenols used in plastic products , pesticides , brominated flame retardants , alcohol , smoking , illicit drugs , vaccines , and prenatal stress , although no links have been found , and some have been completely disproven .
instead , data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others ' viewpoints .
In his review , Kenworthy states that `` the claim of executive dysfunction as a causal factor in autism is controversial '' , however , `` it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism '' .
Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40 % of cases to genetic causes , consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and fragile X testing .
The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD , resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms .
Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism , but may have unrelated causes ;
Unlike with autism , people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development .
In this article , `` autism '' refers to the classic autistic disorder ;
in clinical practice , though , `` autism '' , `` ASD '' , and `` PDD '' are often used interchangeably .
Because the behavior spectrum is continuous , boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary .
Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low - , medium - or high-functioning autism -LRB- LFA , MFA , and HFA -RRB- , based on IQ thresholds , or on how much support the individual requires in daily life ;
one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain , which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects .
According to an article in the `` Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders '' , failure to meet any of the following milestones `` is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations .
Screening tools designed for one culture 's norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture .
Although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical , it can be considered in some cases , such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features .
Intensive , sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care , social , and job skills , and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors ;
06: social-19 JJ -> NN
Medication .
Many medications are used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails .
More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants , with the most common drug classes being antidepressants , stimulants , and antipsychotics .
in 2005 , botched chelation therapy killed a five-year-old child with autism .
Cost .
Treatment is expensive ;
indirect costs are more so .
For someone born in 2000 , a US study estimated an average lifetime cost of $ -LRB- net present value in dollars , inflation-adjusted from 2003 estimate -RRB- , with about 10 % medical care , 30 % extra education and other care , and 60 % lost economic productivity .
one theory is that females are underdiagnosed .
Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism , the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent , and with diabetes , bleeding , and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy .
05: bleed-35 VBG -> NN
As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism ;
now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions .
The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with , and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely .
NOTE : Since it is the ratio of all reflected radiation to incident radiation it will include the diffuse AND the specular radiation reflected .
Albedo depends on the frequency of the radiation .
When quoted unqualified , it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of visible light .
In general , the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incident radiation , except for Lambertian surfaces , which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function and therefore have an albedo that is independent of the incident distribution .
White-sky and black-sky albedo .
It has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo , the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle '' θ '' `` i '' can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms : the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle , formula_1 , and the bi-hemispherical reflectance , formula_2 the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination formula_3 .
Deciduous trees have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas coniferous trees have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15 .
They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool ;
Water .
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials .
At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner -LRB- not diffusely -RRB- .
However , as mentioned above , waviness causes an appreciable reduction .
Note that white caps on waves look white -LRB- and have high albedo -RRB- because the water is foamed up , so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect , adding up their reflectivities .
Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds , such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic .
The direct -LRB- albedo -RRB- effect is generally to cool the planet ;
the indirect effect -LRB- the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties -RRB- is less certain .
Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo .
Other types of albedo .
Single-scattering albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles .
the size of the particle or particles ;

The Port of Mobile , Alabama 's only saltwater port , is a large seaport on the Gulf of Mexico with inland waterway access to the Midwest by way of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway .
The newly expanded container terminal at the Port of Mobile was ranked as the 25th busiest for container traffic in the nation during 2011 .
, `` Akhilleus '' , -RRB- was a Greek hero of the Trojan War and the central character and greatest warrior of Homer 's `` Iliad '' .
Later legends -LRB- beginning with a poem by Statius in the 1st century AD -RRB- state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel .
`` Laos '' has been construed by Gregory Nagy , following Leonard Palmer , to mean `` a corps of soldiers '' , a muster .
With this derivation , the name would have a double meaning in the poem : when the hero is functioning rightly , his men bring grief to the enemy , but when wrongly , his men get the grief of war .
According to the `` Achilleid '' , written by Statius in the 1st century AD , and to no surviving previous sources , when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal , by dipping him in the river Styx .
in the later vase paintings presenting Achilles ' death , the arrow -LRB- or in many cases , arrows -RRB- hit his body .
Peleus entrusted Achilles to Chiron the Centaur , on Mt. Pelion , to be reared .

Achilles in the Trojan War .
The first two lines of the `` Iliad '' read :
Achilles ' consuming rage is at times wavering , but at other times he can not be cooled .
The humanization of Achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the narrative .
According to the `` Iliad '' , Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships , each carrying 50 Myrmidons -LRB- Book 2 -RRB- .
He appointed five leaders -LRB- each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons -RRB- : Menesthius , Eudorus , Peisander , Phoenix and Alcimedon -LRB- Book 16 -RRB- .
In the resulting battle , Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal ;
Telephus consulted an oracle , who stated that `` he that wounded shall heal '' .
02: telephus-1 VBZ -> NNS
According to other reports in Euripides ' lost play about Telephus , he went to Aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound .
Odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound ;
Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed .
Despite his youth , he was one of the main Trojan war leaders .
Prophecies linked Troilus ' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him .
Yet Achilles , struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister Polyxena , and overcome with lust , directed his sexual attentions on the youth -- who , refusing to yield , instead found himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo .
At this same time , burning with rage over Agamemnon 's theft , Achilles prays to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war , so that he may regain his honor .
Agamemnon agrees and sends Odysseus and two other chieftains , Ajax and Phoenix , to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts .
With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction , Patroclus leads the Myrmidons into battle wearing Achilles ' armor , though Achilles remains at his camp .
His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles .
She persuades Hephaestus to make new armor for him , in place of the armor that Patroclus had been wearing which was taken by Hector .
Achilles even engages in battle with the river god Scamander who becomes angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed .
After Hector realizes the trick , he knows the battle is inevitable .
Wanting to go down fighting , he charges at Achilles with his only weapon , his sword , but misses .
Accepting his fate , Hector begs Achilles , not to spare his life , but to treat his body with respect after killing him .
Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot during Patroclus ' funeral games .
With the assistance of the god Hermes , Hector 's father , Priam , goes to Achilles ' tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector 's body so that he can be buried .
Following the death of Patroclus , Achilles ' closest companion was Nestor 's son Antilochus .
Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the `` Iliad '' 's description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles ' reaction to it .
All of these versions deny Paris any sort of valor , owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was , and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield .
The city was visited in 333 BC by Alexander the Great , who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the `` Iliad '' with him , but his court biographers do not mention the spear .
But ancient Greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual , and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women .
In this island there is also Achilles ' temple and his statue '' .
Ruins of a square temple 30 meters to a side , possibly that dedicated to Achilles , were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823 , but there has been no modern archeological work done on the island .
Here is his temple and his statue , an archaic work .
In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts , craters , rings and precious stones , offered to Achilles in gratitude .
Some of these are worded in Patroclus ' honor , because those who wish to be favored by Achilles , honor Patroclus at the same time .
But there are others , who are forced to come to this island by sea storms .
They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island , and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair .
To some of the people who come to this island , Achilles appears in dreams , to others he would appear even during their navigation , if they were not too far away , and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships '' .
According to this story , Odysseus learns from the prophet Calchas that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles ' aid .
When Achilles instantly takes up the spear , Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign .
07: disguise-13 VB -> NN
while the women flee in panic , Achilles prepares to defend the court , thus giving his identity away .
One of these is Achilles , who when greeted as `` blessed in life , blessed in death '' , responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead .
Some also said he married Medea , and that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades -- as Hera promised Thetis in Apollonius ' `` Argonautica '' .
The tragedian Sophocles also wrote `` The Lovers of Achilles '' , a play with Achilles as the main character .
Euripides refers to Achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in `` Hecuba '' , `` Electra '' , and `` Iphigenia in Aulis '' .
Achilles in Roman and medieval literature .
The Romans , who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy , took a highly negative view of Achilles .
Other writers , such as Catullus , Propertius , and Ovid , represent a second strand of disparagement , with an emphasis on Achilles ' erotic career .
Achilles was described by the Byzantine chronicler Leo the Deacon , not as Hellene , but as Scythian , while according to the Byzantine author John Malalas , his army was made up of a tribe previously known as Myrmidons and later as Bulgars .
As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party , Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans , who demanded harsher treatment of the South , War Democrats , who called for more compromise , anti-war Democrats -LRB- called Copperheads -RRB- , who despised him , and irreconcilable secessionists , who plotted his assassination .
Lincoln 's paternal grandfather and namesake , Captain Abraham Lincoln , moved the family from Virginia to Jefferson County , Kentucky in the 1780s .
however , the debate continues over whether she was born out of wedlock .
Lucy Hanks migrated to Kentucky with her daughter , Nancy .
The two women resided with relatives in Washington County , Kentucky .
They became the parents of three children : Sarah , born on February 10 , 1807 ;
Abraham , on February 12 , 1809 ;
and another son , Thomas , who died in infancy .
Thomas Lincoln bought or leased several farms in Kentucky , including the Sinking Spring farm , where Abraham was born ;
In 1815 a claimant in another land dispute sought to eject the family from the farm .
In 1816 the family moved north across the Ohio River to Indiana , a free , non-slaveholding territory , where they settled in an `` unbroken forest '' in Hurricane Township , Perry County .
Within a year of the family 's arrival in Indiana , Thomas claimed title to of Indiana land .
Prior to the family 's move to Illinois in 1830 , Thomas had acquired an additional twenty acres of land adjacent to his property .
As a youth , Lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with frontier life .
Some of his neighbors and family members thought for a time that he was lazy for all his `` reading , scribbling , writing , ciphering , writing Poetry , etc. '' , and must have done it to avoid manual labor .
Traveling down the Sangamon River , he ended up in the village of New Salem in Sangamon County .
After arriving in New Orleans -- and witnessing slavery firsthand -- Lincoln returned to New Salem , where he remained for the next six years .
Mary did return in November 1836 , and Lincoln courted her for a time ;
In 1840 , Lincoln became engaged to Mary Todd , who was from a wealthy slave-holding family in Lexington , Kentucky .
In 1844 , the couple bought a house in Springfield near Lincoln 's law office .
Mary Todd Lincoln kept house , often with the help of a relative or hired servant girl .
The Lincolns ' fourth son , Thomas `` Tad '' Lincoln , was born on April 4 , 1853 , and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on July 16 , 1871 .
At , he was tall and `` strong enough to intimidate any rival '' .
Lincoln served as New Salem 's postmaster and later as county surveyor , all the while reading voraciously .
He then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading Blackstone 's `` Commentaries on the Laws of England '' and other law books .
He was known for his `` free soil '' stance of opposing both slavery and abolitionism .
His stance closely followed Henry Clay in supporting the American Colonization Society program of making the abolition of slavery practical by its advocation and helping the freed slaves to settle in Liberia in Africa .
Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his Spot Resolutions .
Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil .
One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him `` spotty Lincoln '' .
Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency , Lincoln , who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House , supported General Zachary Taylor for the Whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election .
In 1851 , he represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with one of its shareholders , James A. Barret , who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route .
I can not but hate it .
I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world ... ''
At that time , senators were elected by the state legislature .
Lincoln wrote , `` I think I am a Whig , but others say there are no Whigs , and that I am an abolitionist -LSB- ... -RSB- I do no more than oppose the `` extension '' of slavery . ''
The Senate campaign featured the seven Lincoln -- Douglas debates of 1858 , the most famous political debates in American history .
Lincoln stated Douglas ' popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation 's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states .
most of the state 's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize .
Despite his inelegant appearance -- many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly -- Lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the Republican presidential nomination .
On May 18 , at the Republican National Convention in Chicago , Lincoln 's friends promised and manipulated and won the nomination on the third ballot , beating candidates such as William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase .
Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party , as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government with the `` Dred Scott '' decision and the presidency of James Buchanan .
The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North , and produced an abundance of campaign posters , leaflets , and newspaper editorials .
no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states , and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states .
There were fusion tickets in which all of Lincoln 's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York , New Jersey , and Rhode Island , but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state , Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College .
But he also vowed not to surrender the forts .
The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot ;
This call forced the states to choose sides .
Virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the Confederate capital , despite the exposed position of Richmond so close to Union lines .
North Carolina , Tennessee , and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months .
Historian Allan Nevins says :
States sent Union regiments south in response to Lincoln 's call to save the capital and confront the rebellion .
The Army responded by arresting local Maryland officials .
John Merryman , a Maryland official involved in hindering the U.S. troop movements , petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice and Marylander , Roger B. Taney , author of the controversial pro-slavery `` Dred Scott '' opinion , to issue a writ of `` habeas corpus , '' and in June Taney , acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the Supreme Court , issued the writ , because in his opinion only Congress could suspend the writ .
Republican editor Horace Greeley of the highly influential `` New York Tribune '' fell for the ploy , and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August 22 , 1862 .
Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation , while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites .
For some time , Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves .
A few days after Emancipation was announced , 13 Republican governors met at the War Governors ' Conference ;
By the end of 1863 , at Lincoln 's direction , General Lorenzo Thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley .
In 272 words , and three minutes , Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789 , but in 1776 , `` conceived in Liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal '' .
Nevertheless , Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864 , as McClellan was .
Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864 .
This is often characterized as a war of attrition , given high Union losses at battles such as the Battle of the Wilderness and Cold Harbor .
The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North ;
Grant had lost a third of his army , and Lincoln asked what Grant 's plans were , to which the general replied , `` I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer . ''
After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington , Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched .
Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal ;
Days later , when that city fell , Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital ;
1864 re-election .
While the war was still being waged , Lincoln faced reelection in 1864 .

At its 1864 convention , the Republican Party selected Johnson , a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee , as his running mate .
While the Democratic platform followed the `` Peace wing '' of the party and called the war a `` failure '' , their candidate , General George B. McClellan , supported the war and repudiated the platform .
Shortly after Lee 's surrender , a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated , and Lincoln replied , `` Let 'em up easy . ''
As Southern states were subdued , critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed .
In Louisiana , Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it .
Lincoln 's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness .
06: moderate-10 JJ -> NN
After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation , which did not apply to every state , Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment .
having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen .
He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner 's Freedmen 's Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves .
The Declaration 's emphasis on freedom and equality for all , in contrast to the Constitution 's tolerance of slavery , shifted the debate .
His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism , rather than its legalisms .
Burton -LRB- 2008 -RRB- argues that Lincoln 's republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated .
He said `` A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations , and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments , is the only true sovereign of a free people . ''
In 1861 , Lincoln signed the second and third Morrill Tariff , the first having become law under James Buchanan .
It also established a national currency .
In 1862 , Congress created , with Lincoln 's approval , the Department of Agriculture .
Presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted Santee Dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers , Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants , eventually approving 39 for execution -LRB- one was later reprieved -RRB- .
David Davis , Lincoln 's campaign manager in 1860 , nominated December 1 , 1862 and appointed December 8 , 1862 , had also served as a judge in Lincoln 's Illinois court circuit .
States admitted to the Union .
West Virginia , admitted to the Union June 20 , 1863 , contained the former north-westernmost counties of Virginia that seceded from Virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the Union .
At the last minute , Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play .
Seizing the opportunity , Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13 pm , aimed at the back of Lincoln 's head and fired at point-blank range , mortally wounding the President .
African-Americans were especially moved ;
they had lost ` their Moses ' .
In a larger sense , the outpouring of grief and anguish was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war that had just ended .
He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others .
In the 1840s , Lincoln subscribed to the Doctrine of Necessity , a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power .
After Willie 's death , Lincoln considered why , from a divine standpoint , the severity of the war was necessary .
Others simply claim he had Marfan 's syndrome , based on his tall appearance with spindly fingers , and the association of possible aortic regurgitation , which can cause bobbing of the head -LRB- DeMusset 's sign -RRB- based on blurring of Lincoln 's head in photographs , which back then had a long exposure time .
Defenders , such as authors Dirck and Cashin , retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day ;
Today 's U.S. President , however , seems to be promoting a sympathetic resurgence for his predecessor , Lincoln .
Lincoln has often been portrayed by Hollywood , almost always in a flattering light .
His likeness also appears on many postage stamps and he has been memorialized in many town , city , and county names , including the capital of Nebraska .
Barry Schwartz , a sociologist who has examined America 's cultural memory , argues that in the 1930s and 1940s , the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with `` a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life '' .
Franklin D. Roosevelt , preparing America for war , used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan .
He suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept .
His father , Nicomachus , died when Aristotle was a child , whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian .
His writings cover many subjects -- including physics , biology , zoology , metaphysics , logic , ethics , aesthetics , poetry , theater , music , rhetoric , linguistics , politics and government -- and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy .
The traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy 's direction after control passed to Plato 's nephew Speusippus , although it is possible that he feared anti-Macedonian sentiments and left before Plato died .
Those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not , for the most part , intended for widespread publication ;
In physical science , Aristotle studied anatomy , astronomy , embryology , geography , geology , meteorology , physics and zoology .
Near the end of his life , Alexander and Aristotle became estranged over Alexander 's relationship with Persia and Persians .
Charles Walston argues that the tomb of Aristotle is located on the sacred way between Chalcis and Eretria and to have contained two styluses , a pen , a signet-ring and some terra-cottas as well as what is supposed to be the earthly remains of Aristotle in the form of some skull fragments .
For Aristotle , therefore , epistemology is based on the study of particular phenomena and rises to the knowledge of essences , while for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal Forms -LRB- or ideas -RRB- and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these .
He did , however , perform original research in the natural sciences , e.g. , botany , zoology , physics , astronomy , chemistry , meteorology , and several other sciences .
In places , Aristotle goes too far in deriving ` laws of the universe ' from simple observation and over-stretched reason .
From the 3rd century to the 16th century , the dominant view held that the Earth was the rotational center of the universe .
For instance , he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia .
Geology .
As quoted from Charles Lyell 's `` Principles of Geology '' :
He -LSB- Aristotle -RSB- refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on , and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages .
The concluding observation is as follows : ` As time never fails , and the universe is eternal , neither the Tanais , nor the Nile , can have flowed for ever .
09: flow-30 VBD -> VBN
in air , rain falls and flame rises .
Outside all the other spheres , the heavenly , fifth element , manifested in the stars and planets , moves in the perfection of circles .
Because actuality and potentiality are normally opposites in Aristotle , other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous , or that the addition of the `` as such '' to the definition is critical to understanding it .
Aristotle 's apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole , or aperture , to allow for sunlight to enter .
In modern cameras , this is analogous to the diaphragm .
Aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased , the image was magnified .
Chance and spontaneity .
According to Aristotle , spontaneity and chance are causes of some things , distinguishable from other types of cause .
It is `` from what is spontaneous '' -LRB- but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance -RRB- .
For example : A person seeks donations .
That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum .
However , if the person seeking the donations met the person donating , not for the purpose of collecting donations , but for some other purpose , Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance .
For example , the matter of a house is the bricks , stones , timbers etc. , or whatever constitutes the `` potential '' house , while the form of the substance is the `` actual '' house , namely ` covering for bodies and chattels ' or any other differentia -LRB- see also predicables -RRB- that let us define something as a house .
Bertrand Russell is a 20th-century philosopher who agreed with Plato on the existence of `` uninstantiated universals '' .
Aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things .
In addition , Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals .
So , according to Aristotle , the form of apple exists within each apple , rather than in the world of the forms .
Biology and medicine .
In Aristotelian science , especially in biology , things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others , which contain error and superstition .
He separated the aquatic mammals from fish , and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selachē -LRB- selachians -RRB- .
Classification of living things .
Aristotle distinguished about 500 species of birds , mammals and fishes .
What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates , Aristotle called ` animals with blood ' and ` animals without blood ' -LRB- he did not know that complex invertebrates do make use of hemoglobin , but of a different kind from vertebrates -RRB- .
The highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive , the lowest bore theirs cold , dry , and in thick eggs .
06: cold-15 JJ -> NN
Aristotle , in contrast to earlier philosophers , but in accordance with the Egyptians , placed the rational soul in the heart , rather than the brain .
Many of Theophrastus ' names survive into modern times , such as `` carpos '' for fruit , and `` pericarpion '' for seed vessel .
Rather than focus on formal causes , as Aristotle did , Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme , drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes , and relying on Aristotle 's concept of the efficient cause .
Influence on Hellenistic medicine .
After Theophrastus , the Lyceum failed to produce any original work .
Though interest in Aristotle 's ideas survived , they were generally taken unquestioningly .
It is not until the age of Alexandria under the Ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found .
Ernst Mayr claimed that there was `` nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance . ''
Humans have a rational soul .
This kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds : Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself ;
By soul he simply meant the form of a living being .
Because all beings are composites of form and matter , the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings , e.g. the ability to initiate movement -LRB- or in the case of plants , growth and chemical transformations , which Aristotle considers types of movement -RRB- .
Recollection occurs when one experience naturally follows another .
If the chain of `` images '' is needed , one memory will stimulate the other .
When people recall experiences , they stimulate certain previous experiences until they have stimulated the one that was needed .
Retrieval of stored information is dependent on the scope of mnemonic capabilities of a being -LRB- human or animal -RRB- and the abilities the human or animal possesses .
Aristotle gives an account of his explanation of sleep in `` On Sleep and Wakefulness '' .
While a person is asleep , the critical activities , which include thinking , sensing , recalling and remembering , do not function as they do during wakefulness .
Aristotle explains the phenomenon that occurs when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water .
Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli , dreams will not resemble the actual experience that occurred when awake .
When asleep , a person is unable to make judgments as they do when they are awake Due to the senses not functioning normally during sleep , they are unable to help a person judge what is happening in their dream .
Ethics .
Aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study , i.e. , one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake .
Politics .
In addition to his works on ethics , which address the individual , Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled `` Politics '' .
Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community .
Moreover , he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual , `` for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part '' .
The common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from Aristotle 's understanding .
